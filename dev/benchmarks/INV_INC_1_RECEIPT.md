# INV-INC-1 relation/include delivery receipt

`crates/jazz/benches/relation_include_delivery.rs` measures one local
relation/include subscription while holding the measured change to one inserted
child row. Setup and initial hydration are outside the measurement window; the
window starts immediately before the insert and ends after the resulting delta
has been consumed.

The default accumulated-child ladder is `1k, 2.5k, 5k, 10k, 20k`. It preserves
the existing canary's endpoints, adds three interior rungs to make a slope
visible, and uses increasingly wide gaps so a linear dependence on accumulated
state cannot hide between adjacent points.

Each rung uses three fresh fixtures and emits the median allocation count and
bytes. It also records the delivered delta's root/related-row/edge counts and
auxiliary wall time. Allocations and bytes are the primary signals because they
are stable under shared-host contention; wall time is retained only for
operational context.

The final JSONL line (`phase: "slope"`) reports least-squares slopes in
allocation work per accumulated child, max/min allocation and byte ratios, and
the acceptance rule. The rule requires both max/min ratios to be at or below
the receipt's measured-data-derived `1.025x` threshold. The initial
three-sample baseline measured `1.001031x` allocations and `1.017327x` bytes;
the threshold leaves 0.7673 percentage points of headroom above the larger byte
drift, rather than inheriting the canary's intentionally loose `3x` band. Set
`JAZZ_INC_DELIVERY_MAX_RATIO` to evaluate a proposed tighter threshold without
changing the workload.

Run the full receipt:

```sh
cargo bench -p jazz --no-default-features --bench relation_include_delivery
```

The smoke gate runs the same five rungs with one sample each, since allocation
counters are deterministic for this fixture and the smoke gate needs a bounded
cost. Full receipts retain three samples per rung by default.
