# Query Membership Filters

## Findings

Reference PR #808 (`Support broader query membership filters`) was used only as
a requirements reference. Its intent is:

- widen typed `where` inputs so `in` works on scalar and reference columns;
- translate scalar `in` lists element-by-element;
- cover array-column `contains` for non-text element types;
- keep TypeScript as typed pass-through, with semantics owned by the Rust core.

Current branch support before implementation:

Main implementation gap:

- `crates/jazz/src/node/query_engine/lowering.rs::lower_contains` calls
  `coerce_literal_for_source_field` for `ArrayContains`. That helper targets the
  array column type, so a scalar string UUID needle for `UUID[]` is not coerced
  to `Uuid`, and nullable array element handling would also be shaped as the
  whole field rather than the member type. The core validator already checks
  `contains` needles against the array member type.

## Change Classification

- CLEARLY-GOOD: Coerce `ArrayContains` literal needles against the array member
  type, preserving existing text substring behavior as `TextContains`.
- CLEARLY-GOOD: Add public Rust `QueryBuilder::filter_in` pass-through so
  black-box client tests can exercise core `Predicate::In` without private or
  JSON-like query construction.
- CLEARLY-GOOD: Add black-box Rust integration coverage through public
  `JazzClient` APIs, builder-created schemas, and `row_input!` inserts.
- CLEARLY-GOOD: Document the supported matrix in `crates/jazz/SPEC/6_queries.md`.
- CLEARLY-GOOD: Append the required benchmark-smoke receipt to
  `dev/benchmarks/SMOKE_LEDGER.md`.
- SPECULATIVE: none so far.

## Open Questions

- Literal-vs-column coercion remains intentionally narrow. This work does not
  add broad numeric coercion or string-to-numeric coercion; if broader coercion
  is desired it needs a separate spec decision.
