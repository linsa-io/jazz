//! Telling a client a batch is `Missing` must not be something the client can buy forever.
//!
//! `Missing` is an instruction, not advice: on the peer it drives
//! `retransmit_local_batch_to_servers`, and `force_row_batch_to_servers`
//! deliberately clears the dedup bookkeeping so nothing suppresses the resend.
//! When the batch cannot be completed, the answer buys the work that produces
//! the next question, and the cycle's rate is whatever this side can answer at.
//! Production 2026-08-10: one core pinned, sync dead behind it.
//!
//! One cause of an uncompletable batch is fixed at the source (delivery strips
//! `parents` while the digest covered them, see `delivered_row_reseal.rs`), but
//! the shape has other causes — a member this authority never indexed, a branch
//! mismatch, drift in a payload or its authorship. So these gates are about the
//! ANSWER: how fast it may repeat, how many times, and what stops it.
//!
//! Both emitters are covered, because bounding one bounds nothing: the seal that
//! cannot complete, and the fate request synthesised for a batch with no stored
//! fate — which the replay short-circuit queues for every replayed row, so rows
//! alone regenerate the answer without the seal ever coming back.
//!
//! Stopping must retract nothing: the submission stays, no terminal fate is
//! invented, and a reconnect re-arms the answer. The peer keeps its row; it
//! simply stops being told to send it again.
