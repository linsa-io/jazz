//! Read-your-own-writes must expire. A row this node authored keeps its exemption
//! from server-scope filtering forever, which turns every read into a read of this
//! node's own possibly-stale replica.
//!
//! MEASURED end to end on the live stack (2026-08-17), `unique_names` row
//! `01a0116b-4641-76d1-874b-87a72296fa22` on branch `dev-b32dae47bbd9-main`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   rpc-server store   1 version, VisibleDirect, idx:…:userId = 1
//!   jazz-sync store    2 versions, winner deleted=true kind=Soft,
//!                      idx:…:_id_deleted = 1, _id/userId/uniqueName = 0
//!   handler reading at tier 'edge'   claimants=1 owned=1 outcome="alreadyOwned"
//!   after restarting the rpc process claimants=0 owned=0 outcome="taken"
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing but the process restart changed — the store still held the row. What the
//! restart cleared is `QueryManager::pending_local_row_batches`, an in-memory map filled
//! by every local write (`writes.rs` → `manager.rs`, `local_update = true`) and consulted
//! by `filter_synced_query_scope_tuples`, which keeps a tuple unconditionally when its id
//! is in that map — before it ever looks at the remote scope.
//!
//! The map is cleared only by an INBOUND update for the same object and branch. The server
//! never sends a row back to its author (`inbox.rs` forwards to everyone EXCEPT the
//! originating client, and `forwarding.rs` additionally requires scope membership, which a
//! node holding no live subscription never has). So for a node whose reads are one-shot —
//! the rpc-server's whole backend facade — the exemption never expires, and every row it
//! has ever written is frozen in its own reads for the process lifetime.
//!
//! Product consequence, measured: every uniqueness check reads the node's own replica
//! while believing it asked the server. That is `uniqueName.take`, email binding and the
//! apple-identity lookup.
//!
//! What must NOT break while fixing it is pinned by the second test here: a row that is
//! not yet durable must stay visible to its author even when the server's scope is empty.
//! That is the contract the exemption exists for, and six tests elsewhere in this crate
//! already depend on it.
