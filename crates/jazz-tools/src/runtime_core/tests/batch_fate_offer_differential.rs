//! Randomized differential test: batch fate handling and the reconnect offer
//! set, against a model of their intended semantics.
//!
//! `BatchFate::Missing` is an instruction — "I do not have this batch, send it
//! again" — not a fact about a batch. Both writers used to store it like any
//! other fate, and that is what turned the request into the reason it could
//! never be answered: `merged_with` ends in `_ => incoming.clone()`, so a
//! stored `Missing` overwrote the unsettled `DurableDirect{Local}` underneath
//! it, and `Missing` needs no settlement — so the batch left
//! `pending_batch_ids_needing_reconciliation` for good. For a write committed
//! while no server was attached, that fate was the batch's ONLY ticket into the
//! offer set: `retire_settled_batch` had already dropped its submission and its
//! record and kept nothing but the row index. Measured 2026-08-20: 397
//! unanswered asks in thirteen minutes, presence dead through a socket
//! reconnect and an app restart (commit 58de59884).
//!
//! That is state-and-ordering behaviour across three layers — the stored fate,
//! the retained bookkeeping, and the in-memory caches a restart drops — so the
//! hand-written gates only encode the sequences we already thought of. This
//! compares against a model on randomized streams.
//!
//! The model, in full:
//!
//! * `fate` — what storage should hold. Every non-`Missing` fate merges in
//!   (`BatchFate::merged_with`, applied again by the storage upsert itself);
//!   `Missing` NEVER writes, and is always reported as changed so the caller
//!   acts on it.
//! * `sealed` / `rows_present` — whether this node holds a committed batch's
//!   rows. Row history is never deleted here, so `rows_present` stays true past
//!   every retirement; only the bookkeeping around it goes.
//! * `has_submission` / `has_record` / `has_row_index` — the retained
//!   bookkeeping. `retire_settled_batch` drops the submission and the record at
//!   any tier and the row index only from `GlobalServer` up, which is exactly
//!   the state the production store was in.
//! * `connected` — one upstream server or none. It is not decoration: it moves
//!   `settlement_target()` between `GlobalServer` and `Local`, and a
//!   `DurableDirect{Local}` is terminal at one and unsettled at the other.
//!
//! The invariant, over that state:
//!
//! > A batch whose rows this node holds, whose fate is not terminal at the
//! > node's settlement target and is not `Rejected`, MUST be offered on every
//! > reconnect, and MUST be retransmitted on every inbound `Missing`.
//!
//! Both halves are asserted after every op, along with the stored fate itself,
//! so a stream can never drift into agreeing about offers while disagreeing
//! about what is on disk.
//!
//! No proptest/quickcheck in this crate, so the stream comes from the same
//! hand-rolled xorshift over a fixed seed list the storage and catalogue
//! differentials use; every assertion carries the seed and op index so a
//! failure replays exactly.
//!
//! Backends: the randomized stream runs on `MemoryStorage`, and
//! `batch_fate_offer_differential_sqlite_round_trip` reruns a subset on
//! `SqliteStorage`. That second arm is not ceremony. `MemoryStorage` overrides
//! `upsert_/load_authoritative_batch_fate` (`storage/memory.rs:517,549`) and
//! answers from a live `HashMap` without re-decoding, so on it "the stored fate
//! matches the model" never touches `encode_storage_row`/`decode_storage_row`.
//! Only the sqlite arm proves the fate survived as bytes — which is the whole
//! difference between a fate that outlives a restart and one that does not.
//!
//! Generator limitations (conscious):
//! - One node under test, with at most one upstream server, and fates injected
//!   by hand rather than produced by a real peer. What a server would have
//!   answered is a different question, gated elsewhere (`settlements.rs`).
//! - The node registers no durability tier of its own, so it is a client:
//!   `settlement_target()` is `GlobalServer` connected and `Local` offline, and
//!   `recover_completed_sealed_batches_with_storage` is inert on it.
//! - Rows are never deleted, so `rows_present` is monotone. The defect is about
//!   bookkeeping vanishing out from under rows that are still there.
//! - Open (begun, not yet sealed) transactional batches are exempted from the
//!   "offered ⊆ model" direction only; see `OPEN_BATCH_EXEMPTION` below.
