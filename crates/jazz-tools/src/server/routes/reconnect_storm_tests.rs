//! Behavioural tests for jaz0-a803 (reconnect-storm amplification).
//!
//! These tests drive the wire-level behaviour of a misconfigured or
//! malicious client and assert what the server must guarantee, without
//! peeking at the structure of the mitigation. They cover the two
//! mitigations selected for this branch:
//!
//! 1. **Per-`client_id` connection cap** with evict-oldest semantics:
//!    a single `client_id` cannot pin unbounded server state by opening
//!    many concurrent sockets, and a reconnecting client always wins
//!    against its own stale sockets. Evicted clients receive a
//!    `RateLimited` error frame followed by a policy close so the
//!    eviction is observable application-side, not just at the TCP layer.
//! 2. **Handshake-stage read timeout**: a WS upgrade that never sends
//!    an `AuthHandshake` frame cannot tie up server resources indefinitely.
//!
//! ## What these tests prove (and what they don't)
//!
//! The "concurrent storm" and "idle upgrade" tests are
//! **exploit-primitive demonstrations at sub-OOM scale**. They show that
//! without the mitigations the server accepts the relevant input pattern
//! (many concurrent sockets under one `client_id`; a parked WS upgrade
//! that never handshakes) without applying any bound. They are
//! intentionally small enough to run quickly in CI — they prove the
//! primitive exists, not that it crashes a production host. Severity at
//! scale comes from the analysis on the ticket, not from these tests.
//!
//! The remaining tests are **fix-shape contracts**. They pin properties
//! the mitigation must satisfy: oldest is the eviction target; other
//! `client_id`s are unaffected; repeated eviction keeps live count
//! bounded; the evicted client gets a `RateLimited` signal; the handshake
//! timeout interacts cleanly with shutdown.
//!
//! Each test observes the server only through the public WebSocket
//! protocol and the live `ServerState::connections` map — never through
//! internals of the cap itself — so it remains valid under any
//! implementation that satisfies the behavioural contract.
