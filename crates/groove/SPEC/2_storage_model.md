# groove — Specification · 2. Data & storage model

## Overview

groove rests on a small ordered byte store. All domain concepts — schemas,
records, tables, indices, queries, and the tick — are layered above that store
rather than embedded in it. This chapter defines the storage contract that those
layers rely on, the byte encodings used for records and keys, and the layout
rules for tables and indices. Chapters 3–7 build on these guarantees.

Invariant digest:

- `INV-OK-14`: Base-table writes and durable index/view writes MUST be committed through one storage-atomic batch; if the final batch fails after runtime state advances, the Database...
- `INV-STORAGE-1`: `OrderedKvStorage` implementations MUST return scan results in lexicographic key order and `scan_range`/`range` MUST include keys `>= start` and exclude keys `>= end`.
- `INV-STORAGE-2`: `OrderedKvStorage::scan_prefix`/`prefix` MUST return exactly keys beginning with the supplied byte prefix in lexicographic key order, including prefixes whose finite upper bound cannot be computed.
- `INV-STORAGE-4`: `write_many` MUST apply all `Set`/`Delete` operations atomically at the storage-operation level, and a missing column family in the operation list MUST leave earlier valid operations unapplied.
- `INV-STORAGE-5`: `ReopenableStorage::reopen` MUST preserve existing data while adding newly requested column families.
- `INV-STORAGE-6`: Table records MUST be stored as values in the table column family named by `TableSchema::name`, keyed by the encoded primary key derived from the row record.
- `INV-STORAGE-7`: Public insert/update values MUST be interpreted in `TableSchema.columns` declaration order, independent of the `RecordDescriptor` physical encoding order.
- `INV-STORAGE-8`: `RecordDescriptor::fields()` and field indices MUST remain in logical declaration order even though encoded bytes may reorder fixed-width fields before variable-width fields.
- `INV-STORAGE-9`: Fixed-width record scalar payloads and record/array offsets MUST use little-endian encoding inside record values; fixed-width tuple integer members MUST use big-endian order-preserving member encoding.
- `INV-STORAGE-10`: Fixed-width nullable nulls MUST encode as flag `0` plus zero-filled reserved payload width; variable-width nullable nulls MUST encode as only flag `0`.
- `INV-STORAGE-11`: Fixed-width arrays MUST encode as concatenated element encodings without an element count; variable-width arrays MUST encode `count: u32`, offsets for all but the final element, then payloads.
- `INV-STORAGE-12`: `F64` record and ordered-key values MUST NOT be NaN.
- `INV-STORAGE-13`: `EnumSchema` values MUST persist and compare by declaration-order `u8` discriminant; appending variants is compatible, but reordering/removing variants changes stored meaning.
- `INV-STORAGE-14`: Primary-key bytes MUST be order-preserving tagged encodings: integer payloads big-endian, `Bool` as `0|1`, `Uuid` raw bytes, and `String`/`Bytes` escaped with embedded NUL `00 ff` plus terminator `00 00`.
- `INV-STORAGE-15`: Table writes MUST reject rows whose primary-key values do not match the declared `PrimaryKeyColumn.key_type`, and MUST reject table writes for tables with no primary key.
- `INV-STORAGE-16`: Inserts MUST reject an existing primary key, including keys introduced by earlier operations in the same `DatabaseBatch`.
- `INV-STORAGE-18`: Base table writes MUST be staged before the tick and flushed together with durable tick writes only after the tick succeeds.
- `INV-STORAGE-19`: Runtime storage reads during a staged tick MUST observe staged set/delete operations before committed storage, including same-tick durable `Persist` writes.
- `INV-STORAGE-20`: Directly exposed record stores MUST be typed record stores with record-encoded values and order-preserving typed primary keys, while bypassing table batches, primary-key table scans, durable index maintenance, query planning, and IVM ticks. A single trailing variable-width `Bytes` value column MUST encode as exactly the stored bytes.
- `INV-STORAGE-21`: `DatabaseSchema::column_families()` MUST include the `"indices"` column family whenever any table declares an `IndexSchema`, and MUST omit it when no schema index exists.
- `INV-STORAGE-22`: Non-unique durable index logical keys MUST append a `0xff` separator and encoded primary-key bytes; unique index keys MUST omit that suffix.
- `INV-STORAGE-23`: Durable unique indices MUST reject writing a positive delta for an index key already associated with a different record.
- `INV-STORAGE-24`: Persisted index scans MUST decode the persisted index record's `"value"` as primary-key bytes and fetch the current base table record; if the base record is missing for a primary-key table, the index MUST be treated as invalid.
- `INV-STORAGE-25`: Ordered index key encoding via `encode_key_part` MUST preserve logical ordering for supported key values in RocksDB lexicographic order and MUST reject arrays as keys.
- `INV-STORAGE-26`: Windowed record encoding (ch. 2 §2.9) MUST be invisible above the record store: decode∘encode is the identity over record sequences, the storage conformance suite passes identically under windowed and plain representations, and no consumer above the record store can observe which representation is in use.

## Details

Rust names in this chapter (`OrderedKvStorage`, `RecordStore`,
`RocksDbStorage`, …) identify the reference implementation surface. The
normative contract is the behavior specified here.

**Implementation-status note.** The RocksDB reference backend declares its
`lz4` and `zstd` compression features in groove's crate metadata rather than
inheriting them from a consumer such as `jazz-tools`. This is a build-layout
choice, not part of the portable storage contract.

### 2.1 The storage interface: `OrderedKvStorage`

The storage layer supplies exactly the ordered byte map groove needs. It is
partitioned into named column families and exposes a small set of operations
(`OrderedKvStorage` in the reference implementation): point `get`, `set`, and
`delete`; forward range scans over `start..end`; prefix scans in forward and
reverse order; a last-with-prefix helper; and atomic batch writes through
`write_many`.

Higher layers do not treat that byte map as their public storage abstraction.
They work through **record stores**, which are typed storage units described by
a `RecordDescriptor`. Record stores are either groove-**managed** stores
(tables §2.3 and durable indices §2.5, maintained by the tick) or
**directly-exposed** stores (§2.4, declared and maintained by the application).
The backing partitions are still called "column families" in the reference
implementation; at the specification level, higher layers should reason in
terms of record stores.

The only ordering property groove requires from the backing store is
lexicographic byte order. Scans return keys in that order, and `scan_range`
includes keys `>= start` while excluding keys `>= end` (`INV-STORAGE-1`). Batch
writes are atomic: `write_many` applies every operation in the batch or none of
them; if any operation is invalid, no operation partially applies
(`INV-STORAGE-4`).

_Further invariants._ `INV-STORAGE-2` — `scan_prefix` returns exactly the keys
with the given byte prefix, in order, including prefixes with no finite upper
bound. `INV-STORAGE-5` (prov) — `ReopenableStorage::reopen` preserves existing
data while adding newly requested families.

**Implementation-status note.** The shared storage conformance tests exercise
ordering, prefix upper-bound handling, and failed-batch atomicity on the host
memory backend. The wasm-only OPFS adapter compiles against an in-memory B-tree
fixture; coverage of persistence across closing and reopening a real OPFS
namespace remains a browser-harness gap.

### 2.2 Records: logical fields, physical bytes

A **record** is the stored byte representation of a typed tuple. Its schema is
given by a `RecordDescriptor`, but callers see only the tuple's **logical**
field order: declaration order, addressed by name or by index. The physical
layout is private to the encoder. To make records compact and decodable, the
encoder places fixed-width fields first, then variable-width fields described by
an offset table (`INV-STORAGE-8`).

Two value rules protect higher-layer ordering and schema stability. An `F64`
value must never be NaN, whether it appears in a record or in an ordered key
(`INV-STORAGE-12`). An `EnumSchema` variant is persisted and
compared by its declaration-order `u8` discriminant (`INV-STORAGE-13`):
appending variants is forward-compatible, while reordering or removing a
variant changes the stored meaning of existing data and is a breaking change.

The exact byte format for records, nullable values, and arrays is specified in
§2.7.

### 2.3 Tables

A **table** is a managed record store named by `TableSchema::name`. Each row is
stored as an encoded record interpreted by `TableSchema::record_schema`, under
its encoded primary key (`INV-STORAGE-6`). A table must declare a primary key: a
write with no primary key is rejected (`Error::MissingPrimaryKey`), and a key
value whose type does not match the declared `key_type` is also rejected
(`INV-STORAGE-15`). Public insert and update values are provided in
`TableSchema.columns` declaration order (`INV-STORAGE-7`).

Primary keys are encoded separately from record values by an
**order-preserving** scheme. As a result, lexicographic byte order matches
logical key order, including for composite keys. The byte-level scheme and the
set of valid key types are specified in §2.8.

`ForeignKey` and `PrimaryKey.generated` are **reserved metadata** in the schema.
They are carried as schema annotations for validation and planning.

_Further invariants._ `INV-STORAGE-16` — an insert rejects an already-present
primary key, including one introduced by an earlier op in the same batch
(`Error::DuplicatePrimaryKey`).

### 2.4 Directly-exposed record stores

Some application data needs typed persistence without table maintenance. A
**directly-exposed record store** provides that path: the application declares
the store and is responsible for reading and writing it. A
`DirectRecordStoreSchema` defines both the typed key `RecordDescriptor` and the
value `RecordDescriptor`; `Database::direct_record_store` returns a typed handle
with `set`, `get`, `delete`, `range`, `prefix`, and `write_many` operations that
use order-preserving typed primary keys and record-encoded values.

Directly-exposed stores are outside table batches, durable index maintenance,
query planning, and the tick. A write produces no delta and notifies no
subscription, but the store remains a typed record store like any other
(`INV-STORAGE-20`). When the value descriptor contains a single trailing
variable-width `Bytes` column, that column encodes to exactly the stored bytes,
so opaque payloads add no encoding overhead. This makes directly-exposed stores
appropriate for data that does not need incremental maintenance, such as
persistent caches and large binary content. jazz uses them for large-value
content: extents, offsets, and checkpoints (ch. 12).

### 2.5 Durable secondary indices

A durable secondary index is stored separately from the base table rows it
indexes, while each entry remains tied back to a primary-keyed base record.
Schema indices are persisted in the `"indices"` record store under
`durable_index_key_prefix(table, index)`, as records with descriptor
`("key": Bytes, "value": Bytes)`. `DatabaseSchema::column_families()` includes
`"indices"` whenever any table declares an `IndexSchema` (`INV-STORAGE-21`).

Index entries use ordered keys produced by `encode_key_part`, which preserves
logical order and rejects arrays as keys (`INV-STORAGE-25`). An index scan
decodes each entry's `"value"` as primary-key bytes and fetches the
corresponding base record.

_Further invariants._ `INV-STORAGE-22` — a non-unique index key appends a `0xff`
separator + the encoded primary key; a unique index omits that suffix.
`INV-STORAGE-23` — a unique index rejects a positive delta for a key already
bound to a different record. `INV-STORAGE-24` — an index scan resolves the
entry's `"value"` as primary-key bytes and fetches the base record; a missing
base record for a primary-keyed table means the persisted index is invalid.

**Target design (unified arrangement model, ch. 4 §4.6).** Indices are
redefined as a degenerate case of the unified arrangement model: a declared
index IS a durable, pk-ref, implicit-1 arrangement keyed by the declared
columns. `IndexSchema` remains as declaration sugar; the maintenance and probe
paths are the arrangement paths. The `INV-STORAGE-22`/`INV-STORAGE-24` key
encodings become the durable arrangement key encoding. (Terminology: the
spec-preferred term is _arrangement_; "index" remains acceptable user-facing
shorthand for the declared durable pk-ref case.)

**Implementation-status note.** Declared indices currently use the dedicated
`IndexBy`/`Persist` path; they have not yet been folded into the target unified
arrangement abstraction.

### 2.6 Commit ordering

A committed `DatabaseBatch` is the storage boundary at which table writes become
deltas for the tick (ch. 4). Within a single batch, repeated writes to the same
key collapse to one net change per key, so the tick observes each key change at
most once. Base table writes and durable tick writes are staged together and
flushed through one `write_many` call after the tick succeeds. Persisted base
rows and durable schema indices/views therefore share one storage-atomic
boundary (`INV-STORAGE-18`, `INV-STORAGE-19`).

During the tick, reads through the runtime storage handle first observe staged
set/delete operations and then fall through to committed storage. This gives
same-tick read-your-writes behavior for staged base and durable entries. If the
final storage batch fails after in-memory runtime state has advanced, the
`Database` instance is **permanently poisoned**: every subsequent operation
fails, and recovery requires discarding the instance and reopening the database.
Reopening means a fresh open over the same storage, which rebuilds in-memory
state from the durable data. This is a deliberate fail-stop behavior; no partial
rollback is attempted (`INV-OK-14`).

### 2.7 Encoding (normative reference)

This section defines the exact byte encodings referenced by §2.2–2.3.

**Record layout.** Fixed-width fields come first, followed by a `u32` offset
table that gives the _end_ position of every variable-width field except the
last, followed by the variable payloads. For
`[id: u64, active: bool, name: string, blob: bytes]`:

```text
+---------+--------+---------------+------------+------------+
| id: u64 | active | name_end: u32 | name bytes | blob bytes |
+---------+--------+---------------+------------+------------+
```

The first variable value starts immediately after the fixed fields and offset
table. The last variable value ends at the record's end, so its end offset is
implicit. Multi-byte scalar fields and offsets are little-endian, measured from
the record start (`INV-STORAGE-9`). Fixed-width tuple members use concatenated
order-preserving member encodings: integer tuple members are big-endian, `Bool`
is `0|1`, `Uuid` is raw bytes, enum values are their `u8` discriminants, and
nested fixed-width tuple/nullable members recurse (`INV-STORAGE-9`).

**Nullable values** (`INV-STORAGE-10`): a fixed-width null is flag `0` plus a
zero-filled reserved width; a variable-width null is the flag byte alone.

**Arrays** (`INV-STORAGE-11`): fixed-width arrays concatenate elements with no
count; variable-width arrays encode `count: u32`, offsets for all but the last
element, then the payloads.

### 2.8 Primary key encoding (normative reference)

Primary keys use an **order-preserving tagged scheme** separate from record
value encoding (`INV-STORAGE-14`). This is the load-bearing property behind
ordered scans (§2.3): lexicographic byte order matches logical key order. Each
key part is a one-byte type tag followed by a payload: **big-endian for
integers** (the opposite of the little-endian record encoding), `0|1` for
`Bool`, raw bytes for `Uuid`, and NUL-escaped (`00 ff`) + terminated (`00 00`)
for `String`/`Bytes`. A composite key concatenates these encoded parts in
key-column declaration order, so it orders by the first key column, then the
second, and so on. Valid key types are the integer widths, `Bool`, `String`,
`Bytes`, and `Uuid`; `F64`, arrays, and nullable values are not valid key parts.

### 2.9 Windowed record encoding

`INV-STORAGE-8` makes a record's physical layout private to its encoder. This
section lifts that principle from one record to a **sequence of records**: a
record store MAY represent runs of consecutive records as **windows** — one
physical key/value pair holding a bounded number of records in columnar form —
without any layer above the record store knowing.

**Motivation (measured, 2026-07-03).** A single serial text-edit transaction
writes ~10 KV records: ~675 B of physical keys plus ~740 B of values, against
~3 B of new information (the zstd-compressed op log of a 2 000-edit trace is
2.9 B/edit — the compact-history thesis, measured). The bytes are dominated by
re-stating per-record context — repeated key encodings, constant fields,
near-monotone timestamps, parent refs to the preceding record. Windowing
abolishes the repetition instead of compressing it.

**The codec is schema-driven, never semantics-driven.** It lives inside the
record-store implementation — above `OrderedKvStorage` (where keys are opaque)
and below the record-store interface (where both the value
`RecordDescriptor` and the declared `PrimaryKey` structure are known). A
window of N consecutive records (in key order, formed at consolidation time —
flush, compaction, checkpoint — never on the hot write path) becomes one
physical pair: the storage key is the first record's key; the value holds all
N records as **typed columns, key fields included** — record keys cease to be
storage keys at all. Each column independently selects from a small generic
menu per window: constant, delta-varint, dictionary, previous-row-field
reference, verbatim — chosen by measured size, compressor-style. Domain
patterns (same author, chain parents, monotone times) fall into these
encodings because the schema types them and the key design clusters them;
the codec imports no higher-layer semantics.

**No second formats.** The canonical record encoding remains the format.
Runtime code may share, slice, copy, project, or reorder encoded records, but it
must not create a parallel decoded representation and keep that representation
alive as if it were the data model. Decoding is a boundary operation or a
fallback for genuinely computed expressions, not the normal internal
representation for maintained arrangements. The review question is: _is there a
format here that is not the record encoding?_ If yes, it needs a specific reason
and a bounded lifetime.

**Benchmark-status note (July 2026).** The standing canaries are memory
amplification (peak RSS divided by encoded storage bytes) and allocations per
materialized row in the customer cold-start benchmark. After the C-lane
representation work, member 100% cold measured about 6,000 allocations per
row, 7.3s settle, and about 20x memory amplification; member 100% warm had
previously exposed about 46x memory amplification and remains a design-session
target.

**Implementation-status note.** The reference delta representation follows the
same rule: `RecordDelta`
carries `bytes::Bytes` handles to encoded records; pass-through operators clone
handles, not record byte vectors; transform operators build a batch of output
records into `BytesMut`, freeze once, and emit `Bytes` slices for individual
records; consolidation uses in-place sort plus adjacent weight folding; and
join-key construction uses inline small buffers for common keys. This is an
ownership and buffering change only. The record bytes are still the canonical
encoding, and storage-read boundaries wrap owned storage bytes into shared
handles rather than introducing a second payload format.

**Windows are physical, not semantic.** There is no run-sealing judgment: a
window closes when full (bounded to a CPU-cache-sized decode, on the order of
a few hundred records / few KB). A window of mixed traffic degrades gracefully
to dictionary/verbatim encodings — a "bad" window costs bytes, never
correctness. Reads decode the covering window transiently (floor-seek on the
window key, then in-window search over decoded key columns); the ordered
contract of §2.1 is preserved through the accessor.

**Write path.** Hot appends are deltas — via an optional storage capability
("append a small delta to a growing value with delta-cost durability"), which
RocksDB provides as a merge operator, the OPFS B+tree provides as a hot-leaf
upsert plus WAL delta-append, and the memory backend trivially. Backends
without the capability fall back to rewriting the open window value, bounded
by the window size. Which record stores opt in is a per-class attribute
alongside the class compaction profiles (append-forever classes first).

_Further invariant._ `INV-STORAGE-26` — windowed encoding is invisible
above the record store: `decode ∘ encode` is the identity over record
sequences, the storage conformance suite passes identically under windowed and
plain representations, and no consumer above the record store can observe
which representation is in use.

**Implementation-status note.** The reference implementation uses windowed
history consolidation. `history_windows_are_transparent_to_subscription_hydration`,
`post_tick_history_consolidation_preserves_live_subscription_deltas_and_hydration`,
and `history_consolidation_visits_direct_record_stores` verify that the
representation remains invisible to record-store consumers.

### 2.12 Subsumed storage backlog

The former top-level storage notes are now represented by this chapter's
ordered-key/value and record-store contract. Raw table instances, durable
indices, catalogue-like record stores, row-history payloads, visible/current
payloads, and backend-specific persistence are implementation choices under the
same ordered byte-range API. Browser OPFS, SQLite, RocksDB, memory, and future
host-provided backends must be judged by the portable contract here before a
consumer crate advertises them.

The storage-physics notes are performance guidance, not a new semantic model.
Column-family-per-physical-class layouts, per-class compaction/compression, row
encoding improvements, and bounded eviction should be evaluated through the
benchmark/performance chapters while preserving ordered scans, atomic batches,
record descriptors, and reopen/migration diagnostics.

## Open Questions

### Open questions

- 🔶 **Portable backend contract.** Before exposing storage through WASM/NAPI or
  a server package, pin which guarantees every backend must provide beyond the
  current reference surface: ordered key/value operations, atomic batches,
  prefix/range scans, reopen behavior, snapshot/read-timestamp semantics,
  durability-tier reporting, migration metadata, and raw content-store hooks.
  RocksDB column-family terminology must remain an implementation detail; the
  FFI-facing contract should speak in terms of named record-store partitions and
  ordered byte ranges.
- 🔶 **`reopen` normativity.** Is reopen-preserves-data (`INV-STORAGE-5`, prov)
  required of all conformant backends or only this implementation? Host coverage
  exists for `MemoryStorage`; OPFS currently has only wasm-gated compile coverage
  through its in-memory B-tree fixture, not a runnable browser test that closes
  and reopens a real OPFS namespace.
- 🔶 **Warm-reopen arrangement snapshots.** A proposed warm-reopen optimization
  would persist derived arrangement snapshots in a relaxed-durability storage
  class, stamped with the storage frontier they are consistent through. A clean
  shutdown would write snapshots for shapes or canonical fragments; reopen would
  load a snapshot only when its stamp matches the current frontier and otherwise
  rebuild from base data. Crash safety comes from treating snapshots as derived
  state: a missing or stale snapshot is discarded. The design is deferred for
  now because the flight itemization measured reopen itself at about 49ms, while
  first-serve range enumeration dominated the warm wall; bulk serve enumeration
  and window-decode caching are the load-bearing warm path. Revisit persisted
  arrangement snapshots only if the remaining rebuild cost justifies the added
  storage class, frontier accounting, and eviction interaction.
- 🔶 **Reserved schema metadata enforcement.** `ForeignKey` and
  `PrimaryKey.generated` are reserved for validation and planning; the
  implementation currently carries them but does not enforce them.
- 🔶 **Variable-width tuple members.** Fixed-width tuple members recurse today,
  but a tuple member may not itself be variable-width (`INV-STORAGE-9`, §2.7).
  Allowing variable-width members — by reusing the record encoding (§2.7) _inside_
  a tuple — would let consumers represent structured, variable-length values as a
  native column type instead of a custom encoding. The motivating consumer is
  jazz's large-value op-log, whose ops could then be a true groove column rather
  than a jazz-private byte encoding (jazz ch. 12 open questions).
- 🔶 **Async persistence boundary.** Mobile and host bindings may need
  non-blocking persistence, but the contract still needs atomic batch writes and
  ordered scans. Decide whether async is a wrapper, a second trait, or the only
  portable FFI surface.
- 🔶 **Explicit index declarations.** Storage can maintain many indices, but the
  schema/lowering contract should decide which are declared, migrated, and
  persisted rather than auto-indexing every column forever.
- 🔶 **Index staleness fallback.** Update paths must not silently tolerate stale
  indices when old row content is unavailable; either rebuild, fail loudly, or
  prove correctness under partial history.
- 🔶 **Row common-case encoding.** Compact empty metadata, singleton frontiers,
  enum tags, and visible/current rows without weakening deterministic decoding
  or cross-language fixtures.
- 🔶 **Serverless KV adapters.** Future KV hosts must prove ordered range scans,
  atomic writes, durable reopen, and migration metadata; simple key/value APIs
  without these properties are not equivalent backends.
- 🔶 **Compression policy.** Per-class compression/compaction choices should be
  explicit storage policy knobs with benchmark receipts, not incidental RocksDB
  defaults leaking into the portable contract.
