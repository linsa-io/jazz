# groove — Specification · 1. Introduction

## Overview

groove is an embedded database built around incremental view maintenance
(IVM). It supports both one-shot queries over stored data and subscriptions to
maintained views; in both cases, common work is shared inside the engine rather
than repeated by each query.

The system follows the [DBSP "Automatic Incremental View Maintenance for Rich
Query Languages"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16684) approach in a from-scratch
implementation.

The storage model assumes a simple ordered key-value store, such as RocksDB.

groove provides the local substrate for `jazz`, the distributed database (see
jazz `SPEC/`, ch. 14). References to the jazz spec are motivational only; they
are never required to understand or validate groove.

Invariant digest:

- `INV-TICK-1`: A public commit tick MUST advance logical time exactly once and evaluate all durable nodes before evaluating or routing subscription notifications.

## Details

### 1.1 How to read this document

- **Numbered chapters (`1_`…`N_`) are normative**
- **Letter-prefixed appendices (`A_`, `B_`…) are implementation guidance**

**One home, settling over time.** Every chapter uses the same top-level shape:
`## Overview`, `## Details`, then `## Open Questions`. The overview is the
team-onboarding entry point; details hold the normative body plus any clearly
marked in-flight operational material; open questions hold unresolved decisions.

### 1.2 Conventions

**Normative keywords.** MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY carry their
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) meaning. We apply them to
load-bearing statements deliberately rather than to every sentence; unmarked
prose is explanatory.

**Invariants force code-spec convergence.** Stable invariant ids
(`INV-<AREA>-<n>`, for example `INV-TICK-1`) are the anchors that connect the
normative text, implementation, and tests. Important invariants are stated
where the relevant behavior is specified, as ordinary prose with the id in
parentheses. Finer or edge-case invariants are collected in a short _Further
invariants_ block at the end of each subsection.

**Invariant registry convention.** Every invariant has a status and a coverage.
These are orthogonal axes:

- **Status** — its design standing: `now` (the current contract — the default),
  `target` (a committed design), `open` (the design itself is unsettled — see
  the chapter's _Open questions_), or `prov` (a reference-implementation
  property rather than a hard requirement; a conformant engine may differ).
- **Coverage** — whether an enforcing test exists: `✓` or `untested`.

Only non-`now` status appears inline in the chapters. The complete mapping from
each id to its status, coverage, enforcing test, and implementation lives in
the out-of-band registry (`SPEC/INVARIANTS.md`). Implementation status belongs
in a clearly marked Details note, not in an invariant's contract text.

### 1.3 Terminology

Terms are defined where they are introduced. The load-bearing terms used
throughout the specification are:

- **weighted record set** _(a Z-set, in DBSP terms)_ — a multiset of **records**
  with integer weights (`+n` present, `-n` removed). This is the single data
  type that flows on every edge of a query graph.
- **delta** — the weighted change to a weighted record set produced by one commit.
- **arrangement** _(a term of art from incremental view maintenance —
  the heaviest piece of jargon here)_ — the engine's equivalent of a **database
  index that keeps itself up to date**. An arrangement is a maintained, indexed
  copy of a weighted record set, shared across the query graph, so a join or
  aggregate reads its inputs from the index and updates from changes instead of
  rescanning from scratch (ch. 4).
- **prepared shape** — a parameterized query graph whose bindings are _data_
  flowing through a maintained `BindingSource` weighted record set (ch. 5).
- **tick** — one synchronous propagation of a delta batch through the graph to
  every affected subscription (ch. 4).
- **`OrderedKvStorage`** — the ordered key/value interface groove is implemented
  over (RocksDB in production; an in-memory store in tests) (ch. 2).
