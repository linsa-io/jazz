# jazz — Specification · 2. Data model & identity

## Overview

This chapter defines the logical shape of jazz data: the schema model, the
identities that name durable objects, the layout of rows and row versions, and
the lowering from application schema to groove storage. It is limited to
_identity and shape_. Transaction semantics (ch. 3), history and merging
(ch. 4), reads (ch. 5), authorization (ch. 7), sync (ch. 8), schema evolution
(ch. 10), branches (ch. 11), and large-value op-logs (ch. 12) all build on the
names defined here, but their behavior is specified in those chapters.

Invariant digest:

- `INV-CLASS-1`: Column-class shipping principle: upstream-decided mutable state and node-local derived state MUST NOT be shipped as replicated row payload.
- `INV-DATA-1`: Stable wire identity fields MUST use the UUID newtypes (`NodeUuid`, `RowUuid`, `SchemaVersionId`, `MigrationLensId`, `BranchId`, `AuthorId`) in wire byte order; node-local alias types MUST NOT be part of wire identity.
- `INV-DATA-2`: `NodeAlias` and `SchemaVersionAlias` MUST be node-local storage aliases allocated in `jazz_nodes` and `jazz_schema_versions`; all egress from stored rows MUST resolve aliases back to `NodeUuid` and `SchemaVersionId`.
- `INV-DATA-3`: `AuthorId::SYSTEM` MUST equal the UUIDv5 derivation `Uuid::new_v5(&Uuid::NAMESPACE_OID, b"jazz:system-author")`.
- `INV-DATA-4`: `TxTime` MUST encode physical milliseconds in the high 48 bits and a logical counter in the low 16 bits; construction MUST reject values outside those packed ranges.
- `INV-DATA-5`: A `TxId` MUST identify a transaction as `(time: TxTime, node: NodeUuid)`; stored transaction rows MUST use primary key `(time, node_id)` where `node_id` is the local alias for the wire `NodeUuid`.
- `INV-DATA-6`: `SchemaVersionId` MUST be UUIDv5 over `JazzSchema::canonical_bytes()` in namespace `SCHEMA_VERSION_NAMESPACE`.
- `INV-DATA-7`: Canonical schema identity MUST change when a column's `MergeStrategy` changes.
- `INV-DATA-8`: Canonical schema identity MUST distinguish plain `Bytes`, `LargeValueKind::Text`, and `LargeValueKind::Blob`.
- `INV-DATA-9`: A declared `MergeStrategy::Counter` MUST be accepted only on non-nullable integer columns of type `U8`, `U16`, `U32`, or `U64`.
- `INV-DATA-10`: A declared `MergeStrategy::Counter` MUST NOT be used with a large-value column.
- `INV-DATA-11`: A merge strategy declaration MUST name an existing user column of the containing `TableSchema`.
- `INV-DATA-12`: A table read or write policy, when present, MUST name the table it is attached to and MUST validate against the complete `JazzSchema`.
- `INV-DATA-13`: `ColumnSchema::text` and `ColumnSchema::blob` MUST lower to nullable groove `Bytes` user cells in history storage.
- `INV-DATA-14`: History storage MUST preserve each content version's row identity, transaction identity, schema identity, parent set, and user cells.
- `INV-DATA-15`: Deletion-register storage MUST preserve each deletion version's row identity, transaction identity, schema identity, parent set, and deletion event.
- `INV-DATA-16`: The wire row descriptor for replicated row payloads MUST include only `row_uuid`, `parents`, nullable `_deletion`, and nullable `user_{col}` cells; receiver-local currentness and authority-state columns MUST be excluded.
- `INV-DATA-17`: A stored row version MUST belong to exactly one layer: content versions in `jazz_{table}_history` with user cells, deletion-register versions in `jazz_{table}_register` with `_deletion` and no user cells.
- `INV-DATA-18`: Derived global-current storage MUST identify the per-layer winner by row and preserve the content fields needed for global current reads.
- `INV-DATA-19`: The global change stream MUST retain enough table, row, layer, and sequence information to reconstruct global as-of reads.
- `INV-DATA-20`: Schema lowering MUST provide storage for metadata, transaction outcomes, row-version layers, globally accepted current state and change history, and large-value content.

## Details

### 2.1 Column classes (the principle that drives sync)

Sync behavior is determined by what kind of state a stored column represents.
Every stored column belongs to exactly one of three classes, and that class
_mechanically_ determines how the value is shipped and who may write it. The
sync protocol (ch. 8) derives behavior from these classes rather than
special-casing individual columns:

- **replicated-immutable** — `row_uuid`, `tx_id`, `parents`, the user columns,
  `made_by`, read sets, snapshots. Written once by the author, never mutated.
- **upstream-decided mutable state** — `fate`, `global_seq`, `rejection_reason`
  (ch. 3). Written only by the fate authority, distributed as fate messages.
- **node-local derived state** — observed durability, local currency (computed by
  groove `arg_max_by`), and the core-written global-current rows / change
  streams. Recomputed or rewritten from accepted state on each node.

The load-bearing consequence is that only replicated-immutable columns are ever
shipped as row payload (`INV-CLASS-1`). Fate is shipped as fate messages, and
node-local derived state is never shipped.

These three classes cover stored _columns_. A `text`/`blob` column cell is an
ordinary replicated-immutable column (§2.3). Its large _content bytes_ are not a
fourth column class; they are an out-of-band **auxiliary content payload**,
carried on a separate content channel and stored in the raw `jazz_content`
store. Chapter 12 owns that content channel and defines the term "auxiliary
content payload".

### 2.2 Identity types

Cross-node identity is stable because every durable name is a wire-stable UUID
newtype (`ids.rs`): `NodeUuid`, `RowUuid`, `SchemaVersionId`,
`MigrationLensId`, `BranchId`, `AuthorId`, and
`TxId { time: TxTime, node: NodeUuid }`. Global ordering uses `GlobalSeq`
(ch. 3–4). A transaction id combines a packed hybrid logical clock (`TxTime`,
physical milliseconds plus a logical counter) with the writing node; the
transaction is identified and tie-broken by both values (`INV-DATA-5`). The
well-known `AuthorId::SYSTEM` is a fixed, content-derived id that passes all
policies (ch. 7, `INV-DATA-3`).

Storage may use compact local aliases without changing the wire identity model.
Each node interns `NodeUuid` and `SchemaVersionId` to local `u64` aliases
(`NodeAlias`, `SchemaVersionAlias`). The boundary is strict: aliases are
node-local, never appear on the wire, and every value leaving stored rows for
the wire resolves its alias back to the corresponding `NodeUuid` or
`SchemaVersionId` (`INV-DATA-1`, `INV-DATA-2`). Aliases are rebuilt on recovery.
The exact `TxTime` bit-packing and the `SYSTEM` literal are in §2.7.

### 2.3 Application schema

An application schema declares the logical tables, columns, references, access
policies, indexes, and merge behavior that jazz stores. In the reference model,
the schema is a `JazzSchema { tables: Vec<TableSchema> }`; each table carries
`name`, `columns`, `references`, `read_policy`, `write_policy`,
`indexed_columns`, and `merge_strategies`. User columns lower into storage under
a `user_` prefix. A missing nullable user cell means the row version did not set
that column.

Large-value columns are declared as `text` or `blob`
(`ColumnSchema::text`, `ColumnSchema::blob`). At this layer, they lower to
nullable groove `Bytes` cells; ch. 12 owns the op-log mechanics for their large
content bytes. The default merge strategy is column last-writer-wins by HLC
(`MergeStrategy::Lww`). A counter declaration is accepted only on a non-nullable
integer column (`U8`/`U16`/`U32`/`U64`) and never on a large-value column
(`INV-DATA-9`, `INV-DATA-10`).

**Implementation status.** The reference implementation currently provides
`MergeStrategy::Counter` as its non-LWW built-in strategy. Its declaration
constraints are covered by
`schema::counter_merge_strategy_rejects_string_columns`,
`schema::counter_merge_strategy_rejects_nullable_integer_columns`, and
`schema::counter_merge_strategy_rejects_large_value_columns`.

_Further invariants._ `INV-DATA-11` — a merge-strategy declaration names an
existing user column. `INV-DATA-12` — a table policy validates against the whole
schema. `INV-DATA-13` — `text`/`blob` columns lower to nullable groove `Bytes`
cells.

### 2.4 Schema identity is content-addressed

Schema identity is derived from schema content so independently observed copies
of the same storage shape name the same version, while any storage-shape change
names a different version. A `SchemaVersionId` is
`Uuid::new_v5(SCHEMA_VERSION_NAMESPACE, JazzSchema::canonical_bytes())`
(`INV-DATA-6`), domain-tagged `"jazz-schema-v0"`. The canonical bytes cover
sorted tables, names, columns in declared order, types, large-value kind, merge
strategy, and references. They deliberately do **not** include read/write
policies: policies are runtime/catalogue metadata attached to a storage schema
version, so publishing permissions for the same tables can refresh authorization
without creating a second physical storage partition. Changing any storage-shape
input yields a new `SchemaVersionId`. This content-addressing is what lets
multiple storage schema versions coexist (ch. 10).

_Further invariants._ `INV-DATA-7`, `INV-DATA-8` — `SchemaVersionId` changes when
a column's merge strategy changes, and when a column switches among `Bytes` /
`Text` / `Blob`.

### 2.5 Rows, versions, and layers

Rows have stable identity across history. A `RowUuid` names the logical row and
is shared by every historical version of that row. A **row version** is
identified by the row, the writing transaction, and the layer; versions form a
DAG through `parents` (ch. 4 specifies domination and merging). A stored version
belongs to exactly one layer (`INV-DATA-17`): _content_ versions live in
`jazz_{table}_history` and carry the user cells; _deletion-register_ versions
live in `jazz_{table}_register` and carry a non-null `_deletion` and no user
cells.

The replicated wire payload for a version (`VersionRecord`) is exactly the
replicated-immutable fields (§2.1): `row_uuid`, `parents`, a nullable
`_deletion`, and nullable `user_{col}` cells. Receiver-local currency and
authority-state columns are excluded (`INV-DATA-16`). Mixed-version _sync_ is
owned by ch. 8 / ch. 10.

**Implementation status.** The reference codec currently requires sender and
receiver row descriptors to match exactly. Compatibility across differing
descriptors is not yet a settled contract; see the open question below.

### 2.6 Storage lowering

Storage lowering gives the logical schema a fixed groove representation
(`JazzSchema::lower_to_groove()`, `INV-DATA-20`). The lowered schema consists of
node/schema/catalogue/partition **metadata**, **transaction/audit** tables,
per-application-table **layer tables**, the append-only
**`jazz_global_changes`** change stream, and the raw **`jazz_content`** store
for large-value bytes (ch. 12). For each application table, the layers are
`jazz_{table}_history` for content versions and `jazz_{table}_register` for
deletion events, plus per-layer `…_global_current` winner tables. Those winner
tables are node-local derived state (§2.1): they are maintained from accepted
fates and never shipped. The exact table set, primary keys, and indexes are the
reference in §2.7.

### 2.7 Reference implementation: identity encoding & storage lowering

This section records the current reference implementation's identity and storage
layout. It is useful for implementers and debugging, but exact table names,
primary keys, and indexes are not the portable data-model contract. The layout
is covered by `schema::storage_lowering_declares_system_columns_by_shape`.

**Identity encoding.** `TxTime` packs physical milliseconds in the high 48 bits
and a logical counter in the low 16; construction rejects values outside those
ranges (`INV-DATA-4`). `AuthorId::SYSTEM` is
`Uuid::new_v5(&NAMESPACE_OID, b"jazz:system-author")` (`= 93c209ee-…-c0bbcf6a`).
Node-local aliases live in `jazz_nodes` / `jazz_schema_versions` and are rebuilt
from those tables on recovery.

**Lowered tables.** `lower_to_groove()` produces:

- _metadata_ — `jazz_nodes`, `jazz_schema_versions`, `jazz_catalogue`,
  `jazz_catalogue_pointer`, `jazz_partitions`, and the branch-scaffolding
  `jazz_branches` / `jazz_branch_partitions` (behavior in ch. 11);
- _transaction/audit_ — `jazz_transactions` keyed `(time, node_id)`,
  `jazz_rejected_transactions`;
- _per application table_ — `jazz_{table}_history` and `jazz_{table}_register`,
  each PK `(row_uuid, tx_time, tx_node_id)` with index `by_tx(tx_time,
tx_node_id, row_uuid)`; history adds `schema_version` + `parents` + nullable
  `user_{col}`, register adds a non-null `_deletion` (`INV-DATA-14`,
  `INV-DATA-15`). Per-layer `…_global_current` winner tables are keyed by
  `row_uuid`; the content table carries all user columns and indexes only
  references plus explicitly indexed columns (`INV-DATA-18`);
- _change stream_ — the append-only `jazz_global_changes`, keyed
  `(table_name, row_uuid, layer, global_seq)` with index
  `by_global_seq(global_seq, table_name, row_uuid, layer)` (`INV-DATA-19`);
- _content_ — the raw ordered KV store `jazz_content` (ch. 12).

### 2.14 Subsumed table-first row-history notes

The former top-level row-history and row-history-engine notes are now part of
this chapter's model instead of a separate alpha archive. A logical row is
identified by `RowUuid`; application columns and engine-managed metadata are
stored in one flat row/version record; and current reads are served from compact
visible/current state rather than by scanning history. Retained history remains
the source for replay, sync, deletion/restore, and historical reads, while the
visible/current surfaces are derived indexes over that history.

The old alpha wording around reserved `_jazz_*` fields maps to the typed identity
and column-class model here: stable row identity, transaction identity, authorship
or `made_by`, parents, deletion state, durability/fate observations, branch or
schema context, and implementation metadata are engine-owned facts, not
application columns. Catalogue rows stay on the schema/lens catalogue lane
(ch. 10); they are not ordinary user rows even though they reuse the same storage
and sync machinery.

## Open Questions

### Open questions

- 🔶 **`jazz_nodes.uuid` uniqueness.** The README states the interned node UUID
  is unique, but `schema.rs::nodes_table` declares only the `id` primary key with
  no uniqueness constraint. Decide whether UUID uniqueness is a normative
  invariant with storage-level enforcement, or the README prose is stale.
- 🔶 **Mixed-version row descriptors.** What compatibility guarantees, if any,
  must sync provide when sender and receiver row descriptors differ? Ch. 8 /
  ch. 10 own the answer.
- 🔶 **Visible-row common-case encoding.** The old visible-row notes and later
  storage TODO both called out duplication between current visible entries and
  retained history. Decide the compact encoding for singleton frontiers, empty
  metadata, and deletion/register metadata without changing the row/version
  identity model.
