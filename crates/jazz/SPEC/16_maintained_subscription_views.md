# jazz — Specification · 16. Maintained subscription views

## Overview

This chapter names the target serving architecture for query-driven sync:
**every live peer subscription is maintained by groove**. A serving node should
not have a second production query engine for subscriptions. It may keep semantic
evaluators as oracles, debugging aids, or temporary migration scaffolding, but
the protocol-facing steady state is a groove subscription whose terminal stream
contains enough information to produce `ViewUpdate`s incrementally.

The old implementation name for the current prototype is not product
terminology. The intended abstraction is a **maintained subscription view**.

### 16.1 Contract

For a peer identity, query shape, and binding, a maintained subscription view
MUST lower to a groove graph whose terminal rows describe:

- result membership: visible typed result-member additions and removals;
- matched include path rows and join witnesses required for the result set;
- version payload witnesses: content/deletion versions that may need to be
  shipped when a result becomes visible;
- replacement witnesses: current content/deletion winners needed when visible
  rows update, delete, restore, or become newly readable;
- policy witnesses: rows from read-policy filters, joins, and recursive
  reachability that can grant or revoke visibility without changing the output
  table row.

The peer state machine consumes that terminal stream, updates its per-peer
shipped/result indexes, and emits `ViewUpdate`s. It MAY deduplicate already
shipped complete transaction payloads into
`peer_payload_inventory.complete_tx_payloads`. View-complete exclusive payloads
are coverage facts for the maintained subscription view only; they do not become
complete transaction payload refs. The peer state machine MUST NOT answer a live
subscription by running an independent semantic scan.

`groove/SPEC/INVARIANTS.md::INV-INC-1` is the mechanism law for this chapter:
maintained-view ingestion, application, publication, snapshot assembly, diffing,
and subscriber delivery are bounded by the size of the change and affected keys,
not by accumulated view state. `groove/SPEC/INVARIANTS.md::INV-MV-1` and the maintained-vs-one-shot
differential oracle prove observable equivalence; they do not justify a
full-state rebuild or full-state diff on the maintained path.

The high-level `Db` facade follows the same boundary for every live
subscription tier. Local subscriptions are desired and first-class: they are the
application/UI-facing maintained view over the local read frontier, including the
node's own pending committed writes. Edge and global subscriptions are maintained
views over their corresponding accepted-state frontiers, with additional
settlement/completeness requirements. Tiers select the source/frontier
expression and runtime consumption policy; they must not select a different
query engine. A facade-local
full `query_rows` refresh/diff loop is permitted only as explicitly named
migration scaffolding for alpha-compatible local live reads, not as the target
semantics.

The maintained view is a consumer preset over the shared lowered query program.
It requests result-membership facts, path/correlation facts,
payload/replacement/version witnesses, policy witnesses, and settled-frontier
facts as needed, then maps those terminal rows to subscription or sync events.
App-row projection and internal fact emission are separate outputs of the same
program; projection must not become a second diffing path.

### 16.1.1 Application subscription delta contract

The application-facing subscription stream is a stream of result deltas. A
delta contains row additions, row updates, row removals, ordered-position data
for ordered shapes, relation edge additions/removals where the query includes
relations, settled/tier metadata, and a `reset` flag. There is no separate
snapshot event type. The first delivery for a fresh subscription is a reset
delta from the empty result set; reducing that delta yields the initial view.

Consumers own the materialized result set. The contract is that applying the
delta reducer to events in stream order produces the same result as a one-shot
read at the corresponding frontier. Non-reset deltas do not carry a complete
`current`/`all` result. Reset deltas replace all previously reduced state and
then apply their additions; chunked initial hydration is coalesced below this
contract and presents as one logical reset delta whose settled state is reported
at the final chunk boundary.

Windowed ordered shapes expose window-membership transitions as ordinary
deltas. If a row leaves a finite `order_by`/`limit` window and another row enters
because of that boundary movement, the stream emits the corresponding remove
and add/update changes even when the entering row's stored cells did not change.
Per-event work is expected to be O(changed rows), not O(result set); this is the
application-surface form of `groove/SPEC/INVARIANTS.md::INV-INC-1`.

### 16.2 Policy composition

For non-system peers, the maintained graph begins from the shared
policy-composed lowered-query core from ch. 14: the user query intersected with
the table read policy under the authenticated peer identity, lowered over the
subscription's visible-current base source. Claim operands are rewritten to
server-derived parameters before lowering. `claim("sub")` is the stable subject
identity. Recognized claims that do not yet have a runtime value fail closed.

Policy composition is not merely an output filter. Policy dependency tables are
part of the maintained graph. If a membership row, access row, join witness, or
recursive edge row changes visibility, the maintained view must emit the same
net result-set transition as a full rehydrate over the same committed history.
Maintained subscription views are augmentations over that core: they add
terminal membership rows, version/replacement witnesses, and peer-facing
dedup/reset semantics, rather than defining a separate query evaluator.

### 16.3 Recursive reachability

`ReachableVia` clauses lower to groove recursive graphs everywhere they appear:
user queries, read policies, write permission scopes, matched-path witnesses,
and replacement witnesses. Jazz does not branch on groove's internal recursive
execution strategy. Groove owns the choice between incremental recursion and
full recomputation when non-monotone deltas appear.

### 16.4 Production fallback boundary

Full-recompute paths are explicit test/oracle debt, not an alternate production
semantics. Once a shape has been accepted as a supported maintained
subscription, failures in maintained setup, delta application, or maintained
bundle serialization MUST surface as errors/resets on the maintained
subscription surface rather than silently repairing the stream by running a
peer-local semantic full recompute.

A forced full-recompute path is allowed only for tests, semantic oracles,
diagnostics, or an explicitly named migration harness. Such use must be:

- observable through a deterministic metric;
- covered by a regression test that states why the current maintained graph
  cannot yet express the delta safely;
- bounded to a named event kind or maintained-delta failure mode.

The target budget is zero protocol-facing semantic full recomputes for ordinary
query subscriptions. Test-only forced full-recompute paths and semantic oracle
helpers are allowed, but they must not be the normal peer serving path.

Unsupported subscription shapes are a separate capability gate. If a query
shape is outside the maintained-subscription surface, the server MUST reject the
live subscription loudly, or route it through an explicit non-subscription /
read-only API. It MUST NOT accept the live subscription and serve it by semantic
full recomputes, skip the maintained path silently, or install a best-effort
subscription with different semantics.

On a serving sync connection, capability-gapped live subscriptions fail at the
subscription boundary, not at the serving tick boundary. The server compiles the
maintained view for a `Subscribe` request before registering that usage-site
subscription as active. If the compile fails with a maintained-subscription
capability gap, the server emits `SubscribeRejected` for that exact
`SubscriptionKey`, leaves the subscription inactive, and continues serving every
other subscription on the connection. The rejection reason is the stable
protocol reason `UnsupportedShapeCapability`; detailed lowering reports stay
internal compiler vocabulary and are mapped to human-readable diagnostics at
the serving boundary (`INV-SYNC-23`).

### 16.5 Current known gaps

The current maintained-subscription surface supports ordinary live query
subscriptions whose lowered policy-composed shape can be maintained by groove,
with the strongest production coverage on the global frontier. The target
surface is tier-agnostic: local, edge, and global subscriptions use the same
lowering and maintained terminal contracts, differing only in source/frontier
selection and settlement/completeness rules. Supported maintained shapes include
unordered `limit(1)` with offset `0` lowered through `ArgMinBy` over `row_uuid`,
and ordered windows lowered through groove `TopBy`. Ordered windows preserve
the user `order_by` terms, append `row_uuid` as the stable tie field, and retain
the requested finite `offset + limit` window or unbounded ordered suffix
incrementally.

Known gaps fall into distinct buckets:

Staged convergence of read sources:

- same-table visible-current schema projection over compatible current
  partitions installs a maintained groove graph for a single root source with
  canonical natural column add, drop, copy, and rename lenses; table renames,
  projected joins, arrays, reachable traversal, and multi-hop table lineage
  remain unsupported until source-aware lowering exists;
- historical/time-travel reads with filters and joins use shared clause lowering
  over historical current rows; historical reachable is unsupported until
  source-aware reachable lowering exists;
- one-shot settled reads may materialize and post-process the shared shape
  without installing a maintained terminal stream.

These are staging gaps in base-source lowering and serving mode, not permission
to fork the query algebra. As each source becomes groove-representable, it should
reuse the same policy-composed core and differ only in base source and whether a
maintained subscription augmentation is installed.

Maintained-lowering gaps:

- aggregate lowering is not yet represented as a groove-maintained graph
  fragment for subscription deltas;
- `array_subqueries` in live subscriptions must be maintained as part of the
  lowered query program: parent membership, child relation material, relation
  edges, ordering/limit boundaries, and policy visibility must converge with the
  corresponding one-shot relation snapshot, and serving code must not compensate
  by recursively subscribing to coarse child shapes for sync coverage;
- relation delivery is covered by the active
  `groove/SPEC/INVARIANTS.md::INV-INC-1` mechanism canary in
  `crates/jazz/tests/incremental_delivery_canary.rs`. The canary is at the
  `Db` facade level because the current `jazz-tools::JazzClient` subscription
  surface rejects relation/include queries as non-simple table queries;
- application-column projection is a materialization concern layered over the
  maintained membership/version stream; projected subscription payloads must not
  become a second diff engine;
- predicate-policy lowering is incomplete where read policies still require
  direct semantic evaluation instead of a lowered maintained policy graph.

Window limitations:

- unordered `limit > 1` and unordered nonzero `offset` remain unsupported in
  Jazz maintained subscriptions; callers must provide explicit ordering for a
  window or ordered suffix to lower through `TopBy`.

Maintained error debt after a supported maintained path fails:

- some maintained-view delta cases still require conservative handling for
  replacement witnesses and unsupported exclusive sibling cases. Exclusive
  transaction deltas are not a broad full-recompute class: maintained views may
  ship view-scoped partial bundles when only some writes in an exclusive
  transaction match the maintained view;
- `current_rows_update` is not yet fully represented as the same maintained
  query-subscription abstraction for every role.

Each gap should either become a groove-maintained graph fragment, surface as a
maintained subscription error/reset, or remain documented as an explicit
non-subscription/read-only surface. Production peers must not mask these gaps
with semantic full-recompute repairs.

Implementation status for `array_subqueries`:

- Subscription opening: direct `array_subqueries` are accepted at the `Db` facade
  and sync registration surfaces, covered by
  `array_subquery_live_subscription_tracks_child_edges` and
  `subscriber_connection_accepts_array_subquery_register_shape_for_serving_subscription`.
- Direct child maintenance: child insert, update, delete, correlation-key moves,
  zero-child arrays, and parent removal are verified by
  `array_subquery_live_subscription_tracks_child_edges` and
  `array_subquery_subscription_reflects_child_mutations_and_parent_removal`.
- Ordering and slicing inside the subquery: an ordered child relation with a
  finite limit boundary is verified by
  `array_subquery_subscription_updates_child_order_limit_boundary`; other
  ordering/slicing combinations are not yet separately named as maintained
  coverage.
- One-shot equivalence: the maintained first delivery matches the one-shot
  relation snapshot for the covered ordered direct shape in
  `array_subquery_one_shot_and_maintained_subscription_are_equivalent`.
- RLS interaction on the nested table: policy filtering of child array contents
  per identity is verified for relation snapshots by
  `array_subquery_policy_oracle_filters_child_array_contents_per_identity`; live
  maintained policy-change deltas on child policy dependencies need explicit
  named coverage before being advertised more broadly.
- Nesting depth: nested `array_subqueries` are validated and registered for
  upstream coverage by `global_subscription_registers_array_subquery_upstream_coverage`
  and `array_subquery_attachment_registers_upstream_coverage`; maintained
  materialization and delta semantics beyond the direct child level are not yet
  separately verified by a named black-box subscription test.
- Include/requirement mode: optional array subqueries are covered by the direct
  maintained subscription tests. `AtLeastOne` and
  `MatchCorrelationCardinality` are covered for relation snapshots by
  `relation_snapshot_filters_unreadable_children_and_required_parents` and
  `array_subquery_match_correlation_cardinality_requires_every_referenced_member`;
  live maintained subscription coverage for those requirement modes is not yet
  separately named.
- Tier: local/default `Db` subscriptions are covered by the direct maintained
  subscription tests. Global/remote registration and hydration coverage is
  covered by `global_subscription_registers_array_subquery_upstream_coverage`,
  `array_subquery_attachment_registers_upstream_coverage`, and
  `array_subquery_remote_subscription_hydrates_edge_referenced_child_rows`.
  Edge-tier maintained array-subquery semantics are not yet separately named.

### 16.6 Aggressive maintained support: ordered windows and `Aggregate`

The next maintained-subscription expansion should be expressed as new groove
operators or maintained graph fragments, not as Jazz-side refresh/diff loops.
Current and next Jazz lowering targets are:

- `order_by ... limit ... offset` lowers to groove `TopBy`; missing `limit`
  means an unbounded ordered suffix after `offset`, not a Jazz-side full
  recompute.
- `group_by` and scalar aggregate projections lower to groove `Aggregate` when
  every aggregate function is in the maintained operator surface.
- "latest per object" and unordered `limit(1)` keep their narrower existing
  lowerings (`ArgMaxBy` current-row state and `ArgMinBy` over `row_uuid`) unless
  a general ordered window is required.

`TopBy` is the target for ordered result membership. The lowering must make the
order total and replay-stable: Jazz appends stable identity fields, normally
`row_uuid` or another declared primary identity, as deterministic tie fields
after the user `order_by` terms. If the user order is not unique, equal user keys
are still delivered in the same order on every node. Updates lower through the
ordinary groove `-old, +new` rule, so a changed sort key can produce both a
leave and an enter, plus boundary churn for rows displaced at the retained
window edge.

`TopBy` terminal deltas are membership deltas over the retained window, not
whole-window replacements. A row whose rank changes but remains inside the
window does not affect Jazz result membership unless the future API explicitly
projects rank metadata. This keeps `ViewUpdate.result_member_adds/removes`
aligned with the settled typed result-member model.

`Aggregate` is the target for grouped summaries. Jazz lowers each group to a
stable result-row identity derived from the group key and lowers scalar global
aggregates to a single synthetic group identity. The terminal row contains the
group fields and aggregate values; result membership appears when a group first
has output and disappears when the group no longer has output. The group fields
and aggregate values travel as a `ResultPayload` program fact keyed by the
synthetic result member. A changed summary is represented as replacement of the
aggregate result row: the maintained stream must provide enough payload and
replacement witness information for the peer state machine to emit the same net
`ViewUpdate` as a full rehydrate.

Aggregate functions are capability-gated by groove support. Maintained Jazz
subscriptions should initially accept only deterministic, retractable summaries
such as count, numeric sum, min, and max, with deterministic witness ties owned
by groove. Floating-point accumulation, user-defined aggregates, approximate
aggregates, and empty-global-row SQL compatibility stay outside the maintained
subscription surface until their replay semantics and payload shape are
specified.

Policy composition happens before these operators. A policy row changing
visibility must flow through the same `TopBy` or `Aggregate` state as a base row
change, causing ordered-window boundary churn or group-summary replacement as
needed. Jazz must not repair policy-sensitive order or aggregate results by
running a peer-local semantic scan after groove emits a broader delta.

The operational target is O(touched partitions/groups plus boundary output), not
O(result set). The allowed output is still the minimal net subscription delta:
same-tick enter/leave churn consolidates before `ViewUpdate`, deterministic ties
make replay byte-stable, and reset-result-set `ViewUpdate`s remain explicit
attach/rebuild outputs rather than the normal maintenance strategy.

### 16.7 Binding event bridge

The TypeScript/WASM/NAPI subscription surface should be a thin event bridge over
maintained subscription terminal deltas, not a second diff engine. The bridge
needs stable event records for:

- first result / settled state;
- result-row add/remove and replacement;
- matched include path and join material;
- version bundles vs `peer_payload_inventory.complete_tx_payloads`;
- errors, reset-result-set updates, and explicit full-recompute debt counters.

The Rust `WatchHandle` can remain conflated for simple callers, but the binding
ABI must expose enough structured deltas for UI stores to maintain identity,
loading state, and optimistic/settled transitions without cloning entire result
sets on every tick.

### 16.8 Open questions

None at this time.

### 16.8 Subsumed subscription-reactivity notes

The former granular-reactivity and subgraph-sharing TODOs are folded into this
chapter. Maintained views should emit enough structured terminal facts for host
bindings to choose full replacement, row-level deltas, include/path deltas, or
patch streams without rerunning a semantic query in the facade. Framework
adapters may optimize rendering granularity, but the authoritative delta source
is the maintained-view peer state.

Correlated array subqueries require shared maintenance rather than one compiled
graph per outer row. The likely direction is a binding/prepared-shape style
correlation relation that lets parent keys flow as data, then routes child
result changes back to the correct parent output.

## Open Questions

- 🔶 **Granular patch surface.** Define the exact patch/event payloads exposed to
  TypeScript and framework bindings, including row identity, include path,
  ordering/window movement, and deletion/restore transitions.
- 🔶 **Streaming first result opt-out.** Decide whether callers can subscribe to
  live deltas before initial settle, and how to mark unsettle/partial coverage
  without confusing "not loaded" with "empty".
- 🔶 **Correlated subquery maintenance.** Replace one-graph-per-outer-row array
  subqueries with shared prepared/correlation maintenance that remains bounded
  by affected parent and child keys.
- 🔶 **Branch-aware deletion witnesses.** Branch overlays need deletion-register
  terminal facts so branch-scoped views can publish delete/restore changes
  without full refresh.
