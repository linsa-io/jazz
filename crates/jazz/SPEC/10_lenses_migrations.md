# jazz — Specification · 10. Schema evolution: lenses & migrations

## Overview

Multiple schema versions coexist in one database, and migration lenses translate
between them without rewriting history. This is one of jazz's most novel
properties. This chapter defines the catalogue, per-version storage,
copy-on-write-into-current writes, and lens-projected reads. It builds on schema
identity (ch. 2), history winner selection (ch. 4), and the catalogue sync lane
(ch. 8).

Invariant digest:

- `INV-LENS-1`: A published `SchemaVersion` MUST have `schema.id == schema.schema.version_id()`.
- `INV-LENS-2`: A published `MigrationLens` MUST have `lens.id == lens.content_id()` and both `lens.source` and `lens.target` MUST be known `SchemaVersionId`s; `content_id()` MUST hash the canonical lens payload and exclude the embedded id field.
- `INV-LENS-3`: Catalogue mutation messages MUST be accepted only from catalogue admin identity and MUST reject non-admin authors.
- `INV-LENS-4`: Every stored content/register history row MUST carry a schema-version alias, and every wire `VersionRecord` MUST expose the full `SchemaVersionId`.
- `INV-LENS-5`: Unknown-schema commit units MUST park without ingesting a transaction and MUST drain when the corresponding `SchemaVersion` catalogue value arrives.
- `INV-LENS-6`: Unknown-schema shape registrations MUST park and MUST register only after the named schema-version catalogue value arrives.
- `INV-LENS-7`: `CurrentWriteSchema` updates MUST be monotone by `revision`; stale revisions MUST leave `current_write_schema` unchanged.
- `INV-LENS-8`: Durable catalogue schemas, lenses, current-write pointer, and per-version partitions MUST survive node restart.
- `INV-LENS-9`: A current-write-schema pointer flip to a schema with new tables MUST create/reopen per-version history and register storage tables before writes/read scans use them.
- `INV-LENS-10`: New local writes MUST store versions under `current_write_schema.schema`, using the base table only when it equals the node's base schema and a partition table otherwise.
- `INV-LENS-11`: Old-schema commit units with a forward lens path to the current write schema MUST be copied forward into the current schema partition at ingest.
- `INV-LENS-12`: Natural lens reads MUST fan out across registered per-version tables and project rows into the requested schema after schema-agnostic winner selection.
- `INV-LENS-13`: Natural lens projection MUST apply supported operations deterministically in both directions and MUST reject unsupported transformations.
- `INV-LENS-14`: For every non-rejected natural lens delta sequence, translating then applying MUST equal applying then translating for all known schema materializations.
- `INV-LENS-15`: `ShapeId` MUST include the authored `SchemaVersionId`; identical canonical query bytes against different schema versions MUST produce different shape ids.
- `INV-LENS-16`: `RejectSourceDelta` on an old-to-current forward lens path MUST reject the source delta with the declared reason as a normal transaction rejection, not a protocol error.
- `INV-LENS-17`: TransformColumn MUST be accepted only when its transform key is registered as bijective and canonical-equality-preserving.
- `INV-LENS-18`: Large-value columns MAY be renamed by a lens but MUST NOT be content-transformed.
- `INV-LENS-19`: Policy evaluation under lenses MUST translate data into the pinned permission evaluation schema and MUST NOT translate policy bundles.
- `INV-LENS-20`: Per-version tables MUST NOT be automatically garbage-collected; background durable migration may compact current winners but MUST NOT delete historical tables automatically.

## Details

### 10.1 The model

Schema evolution is modeled as immutable catalogue data plus explicit
translations between versions. A `SchemaVersion` names one content-addressed
schema snapshot. A `MigrationLens` names a pure, deterministic translation
between two `SchemaVersionId`s, so old and new materializations can coexist while
presenting a coherent view to readers and writers.

Each lens is bidirectional: it defines behavior in **both** directions, forward
for old→new and backward for new→old. A direction may instead be declared as
`RejectSourceDelta`, which refuses that translation as a normal transaction
rejection (§10.4), rather than producing a translated value. Publishing a schema
or a lens **never rewrites existing history**. Old rows remain in the version
where they were written, and translation happens either at read time or as
copy-on-write at ingest (§10.4–10.5).

Identity is content-addressed. `SchemaVersionId = JazzSchema::version_id()`
(ch. 2), and `MigrationLensId = lens.content_id()`. The lens id hashes a
canonical byte encoding of the source id, target id, declared table lenses,
ordered lens ops, and recursively tagged default values. The embedded
`MigrationLens.id` field is excluded from that encoding, and catalogue ingest
rejects a mismatched id (`INV-LENS-1`, `INV-LENS-2`).

### 10.2 The catalogue

Schema evolution is coordinated through the catalogue, which serializes
publication and write-pointer changes under administrative authority. Catalogue
mutations travel as admin-gated `SyncMessage::{PublishSchema, PublishLens,
SetCurrentWriteSchema}` messages with `CatalogueAck` replies; a non-admin author
is rejected (`INV-LENS-3`). `AuthorId::SYSTEM` is the catalogue admin.

`CurrentWriteSchema` is the single moving write pointer. Updates are monotone by
`revision`, and a stale revision is acknowledged with `applied: false` without
changing the pointer (`INV-LENS-7`).

A commit unit or shape registration that names an unknown schema version cannot
be interpreted yet, so it **parks** as a catalogue orphan. The orphan drains when
that `SchemaVersion` arrives (`INV-LENS-5`, `INV-LENS-6`, ch. 8).

### 10.3 Per-version storage

Physical storage preserves the version under which data was stored. Every stored
content/register row carries a `schema_version` ref, represented locally as a
node-local `SchemaVersionAlias` resolving to the wire `SchemaVersionId`, and the
row stays in the physical table for that version (`INV-LENS-4`, ch. 2).

The base schema uses the base table. Non-base versions have separate physical
storage, tracked with the version partition metadata. When the current-write
pointer flips to a schema with new tables, those partition tables are created or
reopened before any write or read scan uses them (`INV-LENS-9`).

**Implementation status.** The current storage layout names non-base history
and register tables `jazz_{table}_{schemaHash}_history` and `_register`, and
records them in `jazz_partitions`. Those names are implementation details, not
part of the storage contract; `current_write_pointer_flip_reopens_with_new_partition_tables`
exercises the required create/reopen behavior.

_Further invariants._ `INV-LENS-8` — durable catalogue schemas, lenses, the
current-write pointer, and per-version partitions survive node restart
(recovered in a catalogue stage before the groove database is constructed).

### 10.4 Writes: copy-on-write into current

Writes converge on the schema selected by the current write pointer. New local
writes are stored under `current_write_schema.schema`: the base table when that
schema equals the node's base schema, and a partition table otherwise
(`INV-LENS-10`).

Incoming work authored against an older schema is not appended to the old
partition. When a forward lens path exists, the commit unit is
**forward-translated into the current schema partition at ingest**
(`INV-LENS-11`). If the selected lens path declares `RejectSourceDelta`, the
old-schema delta is rejected as a normal `Fate::Rejected(reason)`, not as a
protocol error (`INV-LENS-16`).

The transaction records its author's schema version as **audit metadata with no
semantic role**. A current-write-pointer flip is a core-ordered, monotone
catalogue write (§10.2), and it **never invalidates in-flight work**: a
transaction admitted under the previous pointer translates forward at ingest
like any other old-schema write.

### 10.5 Reads: fan-out, then project

Reads begin from storage reality, then project into the requested schema. A read
against schema S unions the visible-current rows from every registered
per-version table for the logical table, selects content/deletion winners by the
**schema-agnostic `(tx_time, node)` ordering first**, and only then translates
the winning cells into S (`INV-LENS-12`, ch. 4).

Natural lens projection applies supported operations deterministically in both
directions and rejects unsupported transformations (`INV-LENS-13`). The shape's
`ShapeId` carries the authored `SchemaVersionId`,
so the same AST against two versions is two shapes (`INV-LENS-15`, ch. 6).

Merge strategies (ch. 4) consume candidate values **after** translation into the
reading schema. Because translation is deterministic, merge determinism is
preserved; counter deltas translate as values like any other column.

When multiple registered lens paths connect two schema versions, lens path
selection is deterministic over the schema-version graph. The chosen path is the
shortest path by lens count. Ties are broken by a stable ordering of candidate
endpoints and lens content ids; publication or storage iteration order must not
affect the chosen path. Schema updates are rare, so this is specified as a
clarity-first graph walk rather than a hot-path optimization.

RLS policy evaluation under lenses uses the permission-evaluation schema pinned
by the node/admin policy bundle. Row data is translated into that schema before
predicates are checked. The policy bundle itself is not lens-translated: column
renames, additions, and drops are applied to the data projection, and the pinned
policy AST is evaluated unchanged against that projection (`INV-LENS-19`).

The correctness contract (the oracle): for every non-rejected natural lens delta
sequence, **translate-then-apply equals apply-then-translate** across all known
schema materializations (`INV-LENS-14`).

**Worked example.** A row is first written under schema `v1`, landing in the
`v1` table with `schema_version = v1`. An admin flips the current-write pointer
to `v2`, which creates the `v2` partition tables (`INV-LENS-9`). From then on,
_new_ writes land in the `v2` partition, including an old client's
`v1`-authored commit, which is forward-translated into the `v2` partition at
ingest if a forward lens path exists (`INV-LENS-11`). The original `v1` row is
**not** moved: old partitions stop receiving new rows once the pointer moves but
keep their existing historical rows. That is exactly why a read fans out: a read
against `v2` unions the `v1` table and the `v2` partition, picks the winner by
`(tx_time, node)` first, then projects the winning cells into `v2`
(`INV-LENS-12`). Writes are single-partition, using the current partition; reads
are multi-partition, spanning all partitions.

### 10.6 The lens op surface

The lens operation surface is deliberately small and resolved before it reaches
the core.

**Implementation status.** The current core supports `LensOp::{RenameTable,
RenameColumn, CopyColumn, AddColumn, DropColumn, TransformColumn,
RejectSourceDelta}`. Natural projection accepts `TransformColumn` only for a
registered transform that declares bijective, canonical-equality-preserving
semantics (`INV-LENS-17`). The current registry contains only the identity/no-op
keys `jazz.identity` and `identity`; `registered_transform_column_identity_is_accepted_and_projected`
and `transform_column_rejects_unregistered_transform_at_publish` cover that
surface. Additional transform keys are status work, not an invariant.

Large-value text/blob columns may be renamed, but `TransformColumn` over their
content is rejected at lens publication (`INV-LENS-18`). **The core only ever
receives resolved lenses**: a draft lens, such as an ambiguous diff where a
drop+add might be a rename, is a product/tooling concept, and the validation tool
refuses unresolved drafts upstream.

### 10.9 Subsumed schema-file and schema-subset notes

The former schema manager and schema file notes are folded into the catalogue
model here. Developer-authored `schema.ts`, `permissions.ts`, and migration/lens
modules are source material for immutable `SchemaVersion` and `MigrationLens`
catalogue entries. CLI validation, dev-server loading, runtime open, and server
conversion must share one executable-schema gate so a schema accepted by one
path is not later rejected by another.

Column defaults are schema metadata but execute at the write origin: omitted
defaulted fields become explicit cells in the committed payload before policy
dry-runs and before sealing. Literal defaults are in scope; dynamic defaults such
as `now()` require a deterministic authority/origin rule before they can be
accepted. Merge-strategy-only changes still change schema identity because they
change future merge behavior.

## Open Questions

### Open questions

- 🔶 **Binding-facing lens facade.** TS/WASM/NAPI should expose published
  schemas, migration lenses, current-write-schema movement, and catalogue acks
  as stable facade operations rather than leaking partition-table details. The
  ABI should use opaque `SchemaVersionId`/`MigrationLensId` bytes plus structured
  validation errors and deterministic golden fixtures for natural lens behavior.
- 🔶 **Catalogue admin set.** `AuthorId::SYSTEM` is the catalogue admin; the
  implementation has no broader admin set.
- 🔶 **Policy pin movement validation.** Schema versions/lenses may be published
  ahead of the permission-evaluation pin moving, but policy stays on the pinned
  schema until the admin moves the pin — at which point the new current schema
  must have a valid bundle, and a lens that drops a column referenced by the
  active bundle is rejected at publish (same family as the
  missing-backwards-default check).
- 🔶 **Explicit schema-version GC.** `INV-LENS-20` forbids automatic deletion of
  version partitions. If explicit GC is ever added, what completeness,
  branch/history, lens, and audit evidence must authorize it?
- 🔶 **`RenameTable` payload.** `RenameTable`'s payload is ignored in favor of
  `TableLens` source/target during evaluation. Decide whether the op should be
  removed or the redundant payload should be validated.
- 🔶 **Catalogue as a separate lane.** The design distributes the catalogue on a
  lane beside read/write sync; the protocol has the message variants but no
  separate-lane enforcement (ch. 8).
- 🔶 **Schema-projected source nodes.** Projected historical/current reads still
  materialize version-partition rows inside the source resolver. Decide the
  first-class lowered source-node surface for schema/lens projections so
  projected sources compose with the normal query graph instead of staying as an
  inline resolver path.
- 🔶 **Shared core-supported schema gate.** Keep CLI publish, dev server schema
  load, native/WASM runtime open, and server conversion on one validator until
  the public schema vocabulary and executable core support converge.
- 🔶 **Dynamic defaults.** Literal defaults are write-origin expansion; dynamic
  defaults need a deterministic time/source rule and policy ordering before they
  can enter the executable subset.
- 🔶 **Column metadata.** Arbitrary column metadata can help generated UIs, but
  must be versioned, preserved through lenses, and kept separate from executable
  policy/planner semantics unless explicitly promoted.
- 🔶 **Lens hardening.** Preserve hidden newer fields under old-client writes,
  make lens-path selection ambiguity-aware, allow corrected or asymmetric
  migrations where safe, and define type-changing migrations.
