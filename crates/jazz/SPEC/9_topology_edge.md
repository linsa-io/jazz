# jazz — Specification · 9. Topology & the edge tier

## Overview

Tiers in jazz are roles within the single sync protocol defined in ch. 8. They
are distinguished by trust: which node may assign fates, enforce permissions, and
stand behind durability. This chapter defines that trust ladder and the topology
that follows from it, building on transactions (ch. 3), merging (ch. 4), and sync
(ch. 8).

Fate authority is a host-wired role, not a property inferred from data or node
contents. The core accept path and the edge-authority ingest entry point are the
places that assign fates. A node receiving an unfated commit unit through an
ordinary sync application path remains a non-authority receiver for that unit:
it stages or parks the unit pending a remote fate and does not create merge
versions merely because it has the payload (`INV-TX-23`).

Invariant digest:

- `INV-EDGE-1`: A `PeerRole::Relay` link MUST use `AuthorId::SYSTEM` as its link identity and MUST NOT terminate a client identity.
- `INV-EDGE-2`: A relay MUST store/forward `TxKind::Mergeable` and `TxKind::Exclusive` commit units as `Fate::Pending` with `DurabilityTier::Local` and MUST NOT assign an authority fate.
- `INV-EDGE-3`: An edge-client link MUST terminate exactly one client author identity as `PeerRole::EdgeClient { identity }`, and downstream reads on that link MUST use that identity for policy composition.
- `INV-EDGE-4`: An edge MUST NOT assign a mergeable fate until the needed permission-scope subscription has delivered an initial settled result; before that, the transaction MUST remain pending and deferred.
- `INV-EDGE-5`: Edge-local fate assignment MUST support only `TxKind::Mergeable`; an edge MUST NOT use the edge mergeable path to assign fate for `TxKind::Exclusive`.
- `INV-EDGE-6`: `TxKind::Exclusive` acceptance MUST be decided by core, the serialization point; edge authority MUST NOT make exclusive acceptance final.
- `INV-EDGE-7`: Once a transaction reaches `Fate::Accepted`, later stale `Fate::Pending` updates MUST NOT regress its fate.
- `INV-EDGE-8`: Edge acceptance of a mergeable transaction MUST be a final authorization outcome; core MUST NOT re-evaluate or reject it solely because policy changed concurrently after the edge's settled permission basis.
- `INV-EDGE-9`: A cancelled or missing permission scope MUST NOT satisfy the edge permission gate; after restart, deferred edge-fate gates and retained scope refs are absent until client outbox redelivery reopens the gate, while already edge-accepted units MUST survive from edge storage without redelivery.
- `INV-EDGE-10`: An edge MAY use a previously settled permission scope to accept a mergeable transaction only as permitted by its configured freshness policy; the default policy MUST permit unbounded freshness.
- `INV-EDGE-11`: Fate and durability MUST remain separate axes: edge-accepted does not imply `DurabilityTier::Global`; receivers MUST raise observed durability only from explicit durability claims.
- `INV-EDGE-12`: Edge authority and merge coordination MUST route upstream through core rather than directly between edges.
- `INV-EDGE-13`: Resubmitting the same commit unit through another edge MUST be idempotent by `TxId` when the payload matches, and conflicting payloads with the same `TxId` MUST be rejected as `ConflictingCommitUnit`.
- `INV-EDGE-14`: An edge cache MUST NOT evict fate-pending units, permission-scope results currently backing edge acceptance, parked commit families, large-value op metadata, or edge-accepted versions not yet globally durable.
- `INV-EDGE-15`: After eviction, an edge MUST recover required payloads through resubscription without assuming complete local history.
- `INV-EDGE-16`: Duplicate merges of the same concurrent mergeable frontier MUST be legal (identical cells); when independent edge merges diverge, an upstream tier MUST reconcile them by folding over the de-duplicated raw head set (not by re-merging merged values), so `Counter` never double-counts a shared ancestor.
- `INV-EDGE-17`: An edge permission-scope subscription MUST be keyed by `(policy_shape, writer_claim)` — the write policy's query shape bound to the writer's `claim("sub")` — and MUST NOT hydrate a whole-table scope. A public-write table (no write policy) opens no scope and settles immediately.
- `INV-EDGE-18`: An edge MUST share a settled permission-scope subscription among all dependent acceptance gates it can satisfy.
- `INV-LOWER-20`: RLS policy declarations MUST be valid Jazz query shapes; read policy MUST lower through the query engine as part of the policy-composed read graph, while write-time ac...

## Details

### 9.1 The role ladder

Trust is the axis:

- **client** — untrusted; no fate authority; local preview only.
- **relay** — semi-trusted passthrough/cache; never assigns fates or enforces
  per-user permissions; forwards opaquely under `AuthorId::SYSTEM`.
- **edge** — operator-trusted; may finally decide _mergeable_ fates and enforces
  read/write policy for the identities it terminates.
- **core** — operator-trusted; the exclusive-transaction authority and global
  ordering point; history-complete.

Only the core is history-complete. Every downstream node (relay, edge, client)
may hold partial or evicted history, and no protocol step may assume otherwise
(ch. 1, principle 4).

### 9.2 Topology

The topology separates responsibility by placing trusted edge service between
clients and the history-complete core. Clients connect to a relay or edge for
local service and policy narrowing; edges connect upstream to core for global
durability and ordering. The core remains the sole authority for exclusive
transactions, while mergeable fate authority belongs to the first trusted edge on
the upstream path.

Each capability belongs to the tier that can safely exercise it:

| capability                    | authority / behavior                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mergeable fate authority      | first upstream trusted edge; edge-final for edge-accepted mergeables (`INV-EDGE-8`) |
| exclusive fate authority      | core                                                                                |
| read narrowing / write-policy | edge enforces for the identities it terminates                                      |
| durability tiers offered      | `Local`, `Edge`, `Global`                                                           |
| eviction                      | edge cache eviction (`INV-EDGE-14`)                                                 |
| topology                      | authority and merge coordination route through core (`INV-EDGE-12`)                 |

**Implementation status (verified 2026-07-27).** The four-tier tests exercise
edge identity termination and edge fate deferral
(`edge_peer_terminates_client_identity_and_relays_upstream` and
`edge_defers_mergeable_fate_until_permission_scope_settles` in
`crates/jazz/tests/four_tier.rs`). The ordinary committed-unit path remains
core-authoritative outside the partial edge-mergeable path; general edge
read/write enforcement likewise still relies on core. Edge-client links do
narrow reads under the terminated identity. These are rollout status, not
topology semantics.

The canonical alpha-replacement conformance and benchmark topology is:

```text
client main thread (in-memory)
  ↔ client worker relay (OPFS)
  ↔ edge (RocksDB)
  ↔ core (RocksDB)
```

This topology is a deployment shape over the single protocol and API surface. The
main-thread client owns immediate UI-local state, the worker relay owns durable
browser persistence and tab sharing, the edge terminates client identities and
hydrates permission scopes, and core remains history-complete. Scenario smoke
benches may collapse this into in-process nodes while preserving the same role
boundaries; browser OPFS and worker ownership are integrability concerns, not
alternate semantics.

### 9.3 Relays

Relays provide unopinionated transport and caching. A relay link uses
`PeerRole::Relay` with identity `AuthorId::SYSTEM` (`INV-EDGE-1`) and forwards
both mergeable and exclusive commit units without deciding their outcome: stored
units remain `Fate::Pending` / `DurabilityTier::Local`, and the relay assigns no
fate (`INV-EDGE-2`).

A relay may cache encrypted read-side data at rest, but it never enforces
permissions and never accepts or rejects a transaction. The default browser
architecture is a shared-worker relay, where one worker relays for all tabs in
the browser. Server-deployed relays are the exception.

### 9.4 The edge-client boundary

The edge-client boundary is where the system binds a link to a user identity and
applies the last-hop policy view. An edge-client link terminates exactly one
client `AuthorId` as `PeerRole::EdgeClient { identity }`, and downstream reads on
that link are policy-composed for that identity (`INV-EDGE-3`, ch. 7).

Upstream commit-unit uploads on a normal session link are authorized under the
same terminated identity: `made_by` must match the terminated identity unless the
serving link is explicitly trusted as a backend. For a backend link, policy is
evaluated under the backend link identity and `made_by` is stored only as
attribution (`INV-RLS-18`, ch. 7). This is where per-user read narrowing happens:
the last hop to the client.

### 9.5 Mergeable fate authority

Mergeable transactions are decided at the first upstream trusted edge. Before an
edge assigns a fate for `TxKind::Mergeable`, it must have enough policy data to
authorize the writer against the affected policy scope. The gate is strict: an
edge must not assign a mergeable fate until a **settled permission-scope
subscription** covers the writer and affected policy data — otherwise it
registers/hydrates the scope and defers (`INV-EDGE-4`, ch. 8).

After the first settled result, an edge may use scope data only under its
configured freshness policy; the default permits unbounded freshness
(`INV-EDGE-10`). A cancelled scope, or a scope missing after restart, no longer
satisfies the gate; validation defers until the scope rehydrates.

**Implementation status (2026-07-27).** The freshness policy has no configuration
type or enforcement point yet. The existing gate behavior is covered by
`edge_defers_mergeable_fate_until_permission_scope_settles`
(`crates/jazz/tests/four_tier.rs`).

Deferred edge-fate gate state is in-memory by design. Restart drops deferred
fate entries and their retained permission-scope subscription refs; recovery is
the client's outbox redelivering any unit that has not received fate at its
target tier. By contrast, once an edge has assigned an edge-tier accepted fate,
that transaction and its row versions are durable edge state and survive restart
without client redelivery (`INV-EDGE-9`).

`TxKind::Exclusive` acceptance is **core-only** — the single serialization point
(`INV-EDGE-6`, ch. 3). An edge may locally early-reject a provable conflict but
never _accepts_ an exclusive transaction. Fate never regresses: once `Accepted`,
a later stale `Pending` update is ignored (`INV-EDGE-7`).

**Scope granularity.** The permission-scope subscription that gates acceptance is
keyed by `(policy_shape, writer_claim)` — the narrow slice of policy data that the
write policy reads _for that writer_ — not a whole-table scope (`INV-EDGE-17`).
Because a write policy is itself a jazz query shape (`INV-LOWER-20`), binding it
to the writer's `claim("sub")` narrows hydration to exactly the rows the policy
would read for that writer. An edge therefore holds only the policy data for the
identities it terminates, rather than every tenant's data.

The acceptance gate, defer/rehydrate bookkeeping, and eviction pin set (§9.8)
index on this key. A settled scope is shared among every acceptance gate it can
satisfy (`INV-EDGE-18`).

**Implementation status (verified 2026-07-27).** The implementation shares
exact-key scopes; covering-scope subsumption is not implemented. Exact-key
sharing and last-dependent release are covered by
`edge_deduplicates_scope_subscription_for_repeated_deferred_units` and
`edge_releases_scope_subscription_after_last_deferred_unit_resolves`
(`crates/jazz/tests/four_tier.rs`).

> **Edge-final mergeable fate.** An edge mergeable fate is _final_: when core
> receives an edge-accepted mergeable, it performs structural admission checks
> and assigns the global settle position, but does not re-run write-policy
> authorization or re-judge the merge (`INV-EDGE-8`; `INV-EDGE-5`
> mergeable-only).

### 9.6 Fate and durability are separate (across tiers)

Acceptance answers whether a transaction has a final fate; durability answers
where the accepted data is safely stored. Edge acceptance is therefore not the
same as global durability: only an observed `DurabilityTier::Global` means the
write reached core/global durability (`INV-EDGE-11`, ch. 3).

Fate finality and storage durability are independent. An edge-final write can
still be lost if edge storage is destroyed before it syncs upstream.

A disconnected edge continues to serve edge-tier state, including mergeable
transactions for scopes where it is the fate authority. Requests that require
global settlement defer or carry an explicit unsettled/staleness marker; upstream
connectivity is not a precondition for edge-tier service.

### 9.7 Star topology

Edge authority and merge coordination route upstream through core rather than
directly between edges (`INV-EDGE-12`). Client mobility across edges needs
nothing special: resubmitting a transaction to another edge is idempotent by `TxId`
(`INV-EDGE-13`, ch. 8), and two edges accepting concurrent mergeables is ordinary
merging (ch. 4).

Duplicate merges of the same concurrent frontier are legal because they carry
identical cells. When independent edge merges diverge, an upstream tier
reconciles them by folding over the de-duplicated raw head set rather than
re-merging the merged values, so `Counter` never double-counts a shared ancestor
(`INV-EDGE-16`; ch. 4, "Merging merges"). Nothing enforces the _absence_
of edge↔edge sync at the transport layer; the star is a deployment contract, not
a wire check.

### 9.8 Eviction and refetch

An edge is a cache, so it may shed cold state — but only the regenerable kind.
Cold globally-accepted row versions, large-value content extent bytes, and
materialized checkpoint bytes are evictable. The pin set is never evictable:
large-value op metadata a serving node needs for membership checks (ch. 12),
fate-pending units, edge-accepted versions not yet globally durable (not
refetchable from core until they reach `Global`, §9.6), the scope results backing
an acceptance gate (§9.5), and parked families (`INV-EDGE-14`, `INV-EDGE-15`).

After eviction, an edge recovers required payloads through resubscription rather
than assuming complete local history (`INV-EDGE-15`).

**Implementation status (verified 2026-07-27).** The current recovery path
forgets evicted payload coverage and rehydrates; it is covered by
`evicted_content_bytes_are_restored_by_fetch_and_known_state_rehydrate`
(`crates/jazz/src/node/tests/content_store.rs`). The optional byte budget and
write/settle-recency eviction policy are implementation details, not topology
invariants.

### 9.9 Subsumed topology and server notes

The former alpha transport and sync-manager notes are now represented as role
semantics. The server shell terminates carriers and admission, then hands
authorized links to `Node`/peer state; it does not own a parallel query,
transaction, or sync engine. CORS, WebSocket paths, health endpoints, quota
limits, and dashboard or deployment configuration are shell/product concerns
around this role ladder.

Client and edge cache limits are topology policy. Storage may evict cold
coverage only when doing so preserves fate-pending units, authority evidence,
large-value content needed by accepted rows, and enough resume/catalogue state to
refetch accurately.

## Open Questions

### Open questions

- 🔶 **Server shell responsibilities.** The production server should be a small
  shell around `Node`: listener setup, auth admission, storage configuration,
  health/metrics, protocol version reporting, migration status, and shutdown.
  It must not introduce a second transaction/query/sync engine. Decide which
  pieces live in a `jazz-server` crate/package versus examples while topology is
  still stabilizing.
- 🔶 **True read-recency LRU** — v1 eviction uses write/settle recency because it
  is already present in history. True least-recently-read eviction would require
  per-read metadata writes; that is a product-data decision, not a correctness
  requirement for the v1 byte-budget trigger.
- 🔶 **Client TTL configuration.** The old hardcoded client-state TTL should
  become an explicit cache/staleness option with clear interaction between
  local, edge, and global durability tiers.
- 🔶 **CORS and admission routes.** Server shells must accept normal browser
  authorization headers and preflight behavior without weakening admission; this
  belongs in shell conformance, not the core protocol.
- 🔶 **Edge-local catalogue pruning.** When an edge reconnects with stale
  catalogue state, core replay must be able to remove edge-local catalogue rows
  absent from the authoritative catalogue without deleting unrelated local
  state.
- 🔶 **Edge transaction authorities.** Future edge authority placement must say
  which scopes an edge may decide, how leases or ownership move, and how that
  composes with sharding.
