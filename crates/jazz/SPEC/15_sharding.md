# jazz — Specification · 15. Sharding

## Overview

Sharding is **exploratory**. This chapter establishes vocabulary, sketches the
intended design shape, and records the questions that must be answered before
shard ownership becomes part of the committed architecture. It does not specify
implemented shard behavior (`INV-SHARD-1`).

Invariant digest:

- `INV-SHARD-1`: Chapter 15 MUST NOT describe sharded core as implemented; conforming current implementations MUST treat sharding as an exploratory/open design area. This is a guidance/process anchor, not runtime conformance.
- `INV-SHARD-7`: A sharded implementation MUST assign every non-global row to a schema-declared shard ownership key and MUST specify behavior for rows without a natural root and rows whose ownership key changes.
- `INV-SHARD-8`: Exclusive transactions MUST be single-shard unless a cross-shard serialization mechanism is explicitly specified.
- `INV-SHARD-9`: A cross-shard exclusive transaction MUST NOT be accepted without validation evidence for every shard touched by its row and predicate read-sets.
- `INV-SHARD-10`: A sharded design MUST retain a global catalogue/sequencer for schema versions, lenses, policy bundles, and the ownership map unless it explicitly specifies an equivalent replacement.
- `INV-SHARD-11`: A sharded design MUST define settled positions as per-shard positions or vectors and MUST specify how at(position) and at_time(t) resolve across shards.
- `INV-SHARD-12`: A multi-shard subscription result MUST NOT be marked complete unless completeness evidence has been obtained for every shard contributing to the result.
- `INV-SHARD-13`: Cross-shard permission closures MUST be obtained through shard-core subscriptions or an explicitly equivalent mechanism before a shard-core assigns a fate that depends on remote-shard policy data.
- `INV-SHARD-14`: Rebalancing MUST NOT flip partition ownership in the catalogue until the destination shard-core has the partition history needed to serve that ownership and the protocol has defined treatment of in-flight fates/subscriptions.

## Details

### 15.1 "Partition" is already taken

The term _partition_ already has a precise meaning in jazz: it names a physical,
per-logical-table / per-schema-version groove storage table used by migration
lenses (ch. 10) and branch overlays (ch. 11). Those storage partitions are
registered in `jazz_partitions` / `jazz_branch_partitions` and are durable across
reopen.

Shard ownership needs a separate concept. A shard ownership key identifies where
data is placed for authority and routing; it is not the same thing as an
existing storage partition. For that reason, this chapter always distinguishes
**schema-version storage partition** from **shard ownership partition** and does
not use the bare word _partition_ for shard placement. The existing partition
machinery is useful analogy and support, but it is not itself shard placement
(its invariants live in ch. 10 / ch. 11).

**Implementation status.** Shard ownership, shard cores, and cross-shard
transactions are not implemented. The current core has one global sequencing and
authority model; this chapter therefore specifies safety constraints on any
future sharded design rather than current sharded behavior.

### 15.2 The likely-v1 sketch (not committed)

The following is a candidate design shape, not a committed implementation. It
assigns ordinary data to shard ownership partitions while keeping the globally
shared coordination surface small:

- **Placement.** Every non-global row is assigned to a schema-declared shard
  ownership key, likely a reference path to a root (workspace/org/warehouse).
- **Mergeable authority.** Mergeable transactions require permission
  evaluation rather than total ordering, so per-shard authority follows the same
  shape as edge mergeable authority (ch. 9).
- **Exclusive authority.** **Exclusive transactions are single-shard only**
  unless an explicit cross-shard serialization mechanism is specified. S4's
  per-warehouse cap discipline (appendix B) is exactly this
  single-shard-serialization shape.
- **Shard-cores + a tiny global catalogue.** Each shard-core is the authority for
  its shard ownership partitions. A small global catalogue/sequencer retains
  schema versions, lenses, policy bundles, and the partition-ownership map.
- **Per-shard settle positions.** Settle streams and snapshots become per-shard
  `(shard, seq)` vectors rather than one `GlobalSeq` line — generalizing the
  `Snapshot`/`GlobalSeq` cuts of ch. 5 and ch. 11.
- **Cross-shard via subscriptions.** Shard-core ↔ shard-core subscriptions carry
  permission closures and query assembly; edges subscribe to every shard-core a
  downstream shape touches.
- **Rebalancing is a handoff.** Because history is append-only and self-contained
  _per partition_, moving a partition between shard-cores is "ship its history,
  flip ownership in the catalogue" — no in-place state surgery. Ownership must not
  flip before the new owner can serve it, and in-flight work must drain.

The former sharding sketch's rendezvous/top-2 replication and two-level
subscription ideas are treated as candidate mechanisms for the same open design.
They do not supersede the authority and completeness questions below.

## Open Questions

### Open questions (the actual deliverable)

The whole design is open, and demand should be validated before committing to
it. A possible **S10-shaped benchmark** is a multi-shard scale-out of the S1/S4
workloads, using per-partition rate caps and cross-shard percentage as the dial.
The load-bearing unknowns are:

- 🔶 **Placement model** (`INV-SHARD-7`, open) — ref-path-to-root vs explicit key
  column; rootless/global lookup tables (replicate-everywhere vs a global
  partition class); and what happens when a row's root changes (move /
  cross-shard transfer / forbidden).
- 🔶 **Cross-shard exclusives** (`INV-SHARD-8`, `INV-SHARD-9`; open) — how long they
  stay forbidden and what replaces them (2PC, a global ordering lane,
  deterministic pre-ordering); how a single-shard write validates a predicate
  read-set whose shape spans shards.
- 🔶 **Global catalogue/sequencer** (`INV-SHARD-10`, open) — retained for schema/lens/
  policy/ownership unless explicitly replaced.
- 🔶 **Per-shard positions** (`INV-SHARD-11`, open) — how `at(position)` and
  `at_time(t)` resolve across shards (independent per-shard with documented skew
  vs a cut protocol); how branch bases spanning shards work.
- 🔶 **Multi-shard result assembly** (`INV-SHARD-12`, `INV-SHARD-13`; open) — who
  assembles (edge / coordinator / scatter-gather), where joins/aggregation
  happen, and what completeness evidence composes per-shard result sets;
  permission-closure latency/staleness across shards.
- 🔶 **Rebalancing handoff** (`INV-SHARD-14`, open) — the protocol for open
  subscriptions and pending fates during partition ownership transfer.
- 🔶 **Intra-shard availability** — orthogonal but multiplied: each shard-core
  picks consensus replication or restore-from-durable-log.
- 🔶 The design is sharded authority; the implementation has a singleton global
  core that is history-complete, has exclusive authority, and maintains a single
  `GlobalSeq` line.
- 🔶 **Adaptive shard growth.** Slot-based table growth and rendezvous placement
  need a concrete migration protocol before they can become part of the storage
  or topology contract.
- 🔶 **Subscription assembly during migration.** Rebalancing may require
  dual-subscribe or handoff witnesses so live shapes remain complete while
  ownership moves.
