# jazz — Specification · 14. Lowering to groove

## Overview

jazz's first design principle (ch. 1) is that everything lowers to groove. This
chapter defines that boundary: how jazz schemas, persisted rows, current-row
maintenance, query shapes, sync result sets, and RLS policies are represented as
groove schemas, tables, `arg_max_by` graphs, and prepared shapes. It does **not**
re-own those semantics — each is defined in its own chapter; this chapter pins
only the boundary and the mapping.

For live peer subscriptions, ch. 16 sharpens this into the maintained
subscription view target: the protocol-facing serving path should be a groove
subscription over a maintained subscription terminal stream, not an independent
semantic scan.

- `INV-LOWER-1`: Jazz schemas MUST be lowered into a `groove::schema::DatabaseSchema` before opening the node's `groove::db::Database`.
- `INV-LOWER-2`: The lowered content history table for each logical table MUST have composite primary key `(row_uuid, tx_time, tx_node_id)`.
- `INV-LOWER-3`: Node-local aliases in `jazz_nodes.id` and `jazz_schema_versions.id` MUST NOT be wire identities; wire tx/schema references MUST use `NodeUuid` and `SchemaVersionId`.
- `INV-LOWER-4`: Content versions MUST lower to `jazz_{table}_history`; deletion-register versions MUST lower to `jazz_{table}_register`; a single lowered version row MUST NOT contain both user cells and `_deletion`.
- `INV-LOWER-5`: Visible current rows MUST be computed as current content winners anti-joined with current deletion winners where `_deletion == deleted`.
- `INV-LOWER-6`: Local/non-global current-row lowering MUST use groove `arg_max_by` over `(tx_time, tx_node_id)` per `row_uuid` for both content and deletion-register tables.
- `INV-LOWER-7`: Global current-row reads MUST use `jazz_{table}_global_current` and `jazz_{table}_register_global_current`, not scan full history, and MUST exclude rows whose register global-current winner is `Deleted`.
- `INV-LOWER-8`: `jazz_global_changes` MUST be keyed by `(table_name, row_uuid, layer, global_seq)` and MUST expose index `by_global_seq(global_seq, table_name, row_uuid, layer)` for global-base probes.
- `INV-LOWER-9`: Query lowering MUST begin from `visible_current_graph` and therefore MUST apply deletion visibility before user filters/joins/reachable traversal.
- `INV-LOWER-10`: Parameterized query plans MUST be prepared as groove shapes with binding descriptor and stable name `jazz-query:<shape_id>`, then executed through `Database::bind_shape`; maintained subscription views with hidden routing provenance MUST prepare a clean output graph plus an internal routing graph through `Database::prepare_one_sink_with_routing`.
- `INV-LOWER-11`: Prepared graph lowering MUST preserve the semantics of every accepted predicate shape and explicitly reject unsupported predicate shapes.
- `INV-LOWER-12`: Query shapes whose storage read crosses partitioned or schema-projected data MUST bypass prepared groove lowering; supported root current reads MUST evaluate from projected current source rows, while unsupported joins/reachable shapes MUST fail loudly instead of falling back to the semantic oracle.
- `INV-LOWER-13`: Aggregation, ordinary read ordering, general pagination, and projection MUST be applied by the node after row materialization, not required from groove lowering, except maintained unordered `limit(1)` with offset `0` which MAY lower through groove `ArgMinBy` over `row_uuid`, and maintained ordered windows or ordered suffixes which MUST lower through groove `TopBy`.
- `INV-LOWER-14`: Sync query updates SHOULD consume maintained terminal facts for result membership, path/correlation coverage, payload/replacement/version witnesses, policy witnesses, and read-frontier settlement; query-row recompute paths are migration/oracle debt, not an alternate production engine.
- `INV-LOWER-15`: Whole-table current-row sync views MUST be represented as the normal table-rooted row-set shape, not a separate current-row serving engine; their result set must match the node's lowered `current_rows` result while migration code still exists.
- `INV-LOWER-16`: Exclusive predicate validation for non-degenerate shape predicates MUST compare predicate-output-set terminal facts for the shape+binding at `base_snapshot.global_base` to the corresponding current predicate-output-set facts.
- `INV-LOWER-17`: `ColumnSchema::text` and `ColumnSchema::blob` MUST lower user cell storage to nullable `GrooveColumnType::Bytes`.
- `INV-LOWER-18`: Counter merge strategy MUST NOT be accepted for nullable, non-integer, or large-value columns.
- `INV-LOWER-19`: Lowered record wrapper field indexes MUST match the groove schema record descriptors used at node open.
- `INV-LOWER-20`: RLS policy declarations MUST be valid Jazz query shapes; read policy MUST lower through the query engine as part of the policy-composed read graph, while write-time acceptance MAY continue to evaluate policy predicates directly in `node/policy.rs` until write-policy prepared-shape lowering lands.
- `INV-LOWER-21`: One-shot reads, live subscriptions, sync views, and transaction-validation reads MUST consume the same lowered semantic query program; callback/reset/retry/propagation behavior MUST NOT select a second evaluator or become part of query shape identity. Runtime consumers request compiler evidence as app rows plus named terminal facts.
- `INV-LOWER-22`: One-shot filtered current reads MUST select deterministic static access paths when sound: primary-key equality uses a primary-key scan, declared indexed-column equality uses an index probe, residual filters remain applied, and unindexed filters fall back to a loudly counted full scan.
- `INV-LOWER-23`: Position-bounded historical cuts and branch-base reads MUST use the
  `by_table_global_seq` bounded range path when sound, returning the same rows as the
  full-scan currentness oracle while touching only the requested global-sequence range.
- `INV-LOWER-24`: Dry-run policy probes and recursion seed hydration MUST use the same deterministic source access-path selection as ordinary one-shot reads, with equivalence to the full-scan path and counters proving the selected path.

## Details

### 14.1 The boundary

The lowering boundary keeps jazz's data model on a single storage and query
substrate. jazz lowers storage, current-row maintenance, and query/sync
evaluation onto groove, then adds distribution, history, and authorization
_above_ that substrate; it defines no independent storage or query engine for
those concerns. A node opens its `groove::db::Database` from a lowered `groove`
schema and never bypasses it for queryable record storage, current-row
maintenance, or query/sync evaluation (`INV-LOWER-1`).

There is one deliberate exception: **large-value content bytes** do not lower to
groove's record/IVM machinery. Op-log _metadata_ lowers normally (it rides
commit units as ordinary cells), but the content bytes live in the raw
`jazz_content` store below the table/IVM layer, reached through groove's raw
column-family handle (ch. 12). The boundary is precise: anything queryable lowers
to groove; anything only ever ranged-read lives in the content store. Query and
sync row results carry large-value handles, not bodies. Value-returning APIs
materialize those handles by pulling authorized content extents and folding
op-log extents at the access boundary; encoded ops and content handles do not
escape as application cell bytes.

### 14.2 Schema → groove

A jazz schema lowers to a complete groove schema
(`JazzSchema::lower_to_groove`, or `…_with_partitions` when partitions are in
scope). The lowered schema contains the fixed metadata tables, each
application table's layer tables, the global-current tables,
`jazz_global_changes`, and the raw KV store `jazz_content` (ch. 2,
`INV-DATA-20`).

Wire identities remain UUIDs. Lowered storage may intern those identities into
node-local `u64` aliases in `jazz_nodes`/`jazz_schema_versions`, but those
aliases must never appear on the wire (ch. 2, `INV-LOWER-3`).

_Further invariants._ `INV-LOWER-2`, `INV-LOWER-4` — content lowers to
`jazz_{table}_history` and deletion to `jazz_{table}_register`, each PK
`(row_uuid, tx_time, tx_node_id)`, never mixing user cells and `_deletion`.
`INV-LOWER-17` — `text`/`blob` lower their cell type to nullable groove `Bytes`.
`INV-LOWER-18` — `Counter` is rejected on nullable/non-integer/large-value
columns. `INV-LOWER-19` — lowered record-wrapper field indices match the groove
descriptors (debug-asserted).

### 14.3 Current rows → groove

Current-row visibility is the point where content and deletion history become
the row set seen by queries and sync. Visible current rows are computed in groove
as **content-current anti-joined with deletion-current** (ch. 4, `INV-LOWER-5`).
Non-global tiers use groove `arg_max_by` over `(tx_time, tx_node_id)` per
`row_uuid` on the history and register tables (`INV-LOWER-6`); the global tier
reads the global-current tables directly, excluding rows whose register winner
is `Deleted`, rather than scanning history (`INV-LOWER-7`). The
`jazz_global_changes` index (`by_global_seq`) backs global-base probes
(`INV-LOWER-8`, ch. 5).

### 14.4 Queries → groove

Query evaluation starts from the same visibility model as current-row reads:
lowering **begins from `visible_current_graph(table, tier)`**, so deletion
visibility is applied before user filters, joins, or reachable traversal
(`INV-LOWER-9`, ch. 6). Parameterized query shapes lower to groove prepared
shapes named `jazz-query:<shape_id>`, are cached by
`(ShapeId, DurabilityTier, binding-param signature)`, and execute via
`Database::bind_shape` with parameter types taken from the shape
(`INV-LOWER-10`, groove spec ch. 5). The binding-param signature is part of the
cache key because the same semantic shape can be prepared with different
claim- or caller-supplied binding columns after policy augmentation.

There is one intended lowered-query core. That core takes an explicit **base
source expression graph** (for example visible current rows for a table/tier,
historic cuts, snapshot refs, explicit data branches/prefixes, overlays,
schema/lens projections, or branch merges) and a query algebra fragment
(filters, joins, reachability,
ordering/window operators that are in the maintained surface). The base source
is not hidden inside the algebra: current rows, historical rows,
partition/schema-projected rows, branch reads, transaction overlays, and
snapshot refs compose as source expressions, then reuse the same algebra
lowering where their source can be represented in groove.

The lowering request has three orthogonal parts:

- the semantic row-set body, including candidate/proposed-row sources for
  dry-run policy probes;
- the read view and policy context used to resolve sources and authorization;
- the requested app-row output profile plus internal fact outputs.

Runtime lifecycle is outside that semantic request. A one-shot read,
application live subscription, protocol sync view, or transaction-validation
read may choose different callback, reset, retry, propagation, and waiting
behavior, but the compiler-facing way to ask for evidence is only app rows plus
named terminal facts such as result membership, relation edges, read-frontier
settlement, payload witnesses, policy decisions/witnesses, predicate output
sets, and large-value extents.
Those runtime choices MUST consume the same lowered program. They must not
select a second evaluator or make coverage state part of the query shape
identity (`INV-LOWER-21`).

Read policy composes before lowering. For non-system peers, the shape lowered by
the core is the user query intersected with the table read policy under the
server-derived peer claims; policy joins, reachability, and witness dependencies
are part of the lowered graph, not an after-the-fact output filter. The prepared
program's policy sharing key records policy identity plus the claim paths read by
that lowered graph, not claim values. Claim values are runtime binding
parameters, while claim-path sets can vary by policy identity because different
identities can select different policy branches, missing-policy modes,
attribution contexts, or authorization subplans before lowering. This is why the
prepared-plan cache key includes the binding-param signature as well as the
shape and durability tier.

Seeded reachability lowers the seed set as an ordinary relation input to the
closure node. The prepared fragment identity includes the seed table, seed
columns, descriptor, and claim paths, but not the subscribing shape id. This is
the same sharing doctrine as prepared binding sources: two resource kinds using
the same membership closure and claim paths share one maintained fragment while
their outputs still route per subscriber binding.

`inherits(parent_col)` lowering splices the parent's composed policy fragment
into the child policy with correlation rebound to the joined parent row. The
child fragment identity unions the parent's claim paths into its own sharing
identity.

The TypeScript `policy.gather({ start, step, maxDepth })` / `hopTo` surface
lowers to the seeded closure path only for exactly matching patterns: a
claim-keyed start lookup, compatible hop direction, and no extra step filters
whose semantics are not represented by seeded reachability. Other gather shapes
stay on the legacy lowering path and must fail closed if they cannot be
represented safely.

Relation facade unification is staged. The alpha-compatible public
`hopTo`/`gather` query surface arrives at the core as relation IR
(`TableScan`, `Filter`, `Join`, `Project`, `Union`, `Gather`, `Distinct`,
`OrderBy`, `Offset`, `Limit`) and must normalize into the same row-set program
vocabulary used by ordinary queries. The contained v1 slice accepts runtime
value-envelope literals such as `{ type: "Uuid", value: ... }` in relation
predicates and maps scalar acyclic hop paths whose projected output is the path
terminal onto existing `JoinVia`/nested-join shapes. That preserves the lowered
plan shape for already-supported single-hop relation queries while covering the
browser scalar `users -> teams -> orgs` relation shape.

The remaining relation IR operators require first-class row-set lowering rather
than more facade rewrites:

- `Union` should lower to a row-set `Union` with explicit source alternatives
  and a result identity that either preserves branch/source discriminators or
  proves all alternatives are the same logical real-row domain before
  deduplication.
- `Distinct` should lower after the relation input that creates duplicates,
  with stable dedupe keys carried into replacement facts so maintained views can
  retract exactly the affected membership row.
- `Gather` should lower to a recursive relation node whose seed and step are
  ordinary row-set subplans, with frontier keys, dedupe keys, max-depth, depth
  output, and path facts all represented explicitly. It must not be encoded as a
  root-table `reachable` filter when the output row set changes from the seed.
- Array-valued foreign-key hops need membership join semantics
  (`array_contains(left_key, right_row_id)` / `ContainsField`-like lowering) or
  an equivalent path edge operator. Rewriting them as scalar equality joins is
  unsound and would miss multi-valued membership changes.

Maintained subscriptions for those operators must preserve
`groove/SPEC/INVARIANTS.md::INV-INC-1`: relation
membership changes must be scale-independent in unrelated rows. In practice that
means union alternatives, distinct groups, recursive frontier rows, and
array-membership path edges all need terminal facts with enough identity to
route updates to the exact subscribed binding/result member. A staged plan is:
first normalize relation IR into row-set nodes without changing execution;
second lower union/distinct as maintained groove fragments with explicit
identity/retraction facts; third lower recursive gather using the seeded
frontier machinery and depth/dedupe facts; fourth add array-membership join
facts and extend the incremental-delivery canaries to cover scalar-hop,
array-hop, union/dedup, and recursive-gather single-row updates.

Read and write policies both lower through the `node/query_engine` path described
above. Write-time admission enters
`NodeState::write_policy_allows_version_record`, projects old and candidate data
into the policy-pinned schema, selects the matching insert/update/delete clause,
and supplies that row as an inline root source to the identity-aware
authorization subplan. Branch writes use the same program over the branch read
view. Plain child-insert `inherits(parent_col)` selects the parent's
`update_using` clause; explicit `InheritsOperation::{Insert, Update, Delete}`
selects the matching parent write clause. There is no direct predicate
interpreter fallback (`INV-LOWER-20`).

Identity and execution are separate concerns: aggregation and non-maintained
`order_by` are part of a shape's _semantic identity_ (canonicalized into the
`ShapeId`, ch. 6), but their ordinary read execution is node-level
post-processing applied after row materialization, not pushed into groove
lowering. Maintained ordered windows are the exception: finite windows and
unbounded ordered suffixes lower to groove `TopBy` so membership changes are
maintained incrementally. ch. 14 owns that execution-placement statement; ch. 6
owns the identity.

There is one maintained-subscription exception for windowing: an unordered
`limit(1)` with no explicit `order_by` and offset `0` lowers into groove as
`ArgMinBy` over the visible result rows, with an empty group and `row_uuid` as
the comparison key. This makes the chosen row deterministic without claiming an
application-visible order. Ordered maintained queries lower into groove `TopBy`,
preserving user order terms and appending `row_uuid` as the stable tie field;
`offset` is part of the retained window. When the jazz query omits `limit`,
lowering represents the ordered suffix with `TopByLimit::Unbounded`, matching
ch. 6's promise that maintained ordered subscriptions can omit a finite limit
while still preserving ordered membership. Unordered `limit > 1` and unordered
nonzero `offset` remain unsupported until they either gain explicit order
semantics or a separate maintained lowering.

_Further invariants._ `INV-LOWER-13` — aggregation, ordinary read ordering,
general pagination, and projection are applied by the node _after_ row
materialization (not required of groove), except maintained unordered `limit(1)`
offset `0` which lowers through `ArgMinBy` and maintained ordered windows or
ordered suffixes which lower through `TopBy`. For maintained subscriptions, ch.
16 tracks
aggregate/projection/predicate-policy lowering gaps separately from remaining
window capability limits. `INV-LOWER-12` — a read crossing
partitioned/schema-projected data bypasses the ordinary prepared current plan
cache; supported root current reads use projected current source rows, and
unsupported join/reachable projected shapes fail loudly until they have
source-aware lowering. Historical current reads with filters and joins lower
through the shared clause layer over a historical source; historical reachable
still requires source-aware reachable lowering. These staged source gaps must not
create a second query algebra. `INV-LOWER-11` — prepared lowering rejects `!=`
parameter predicates until supported.

### 14.5 Sync views & exclusive validation → groove

Sync view maintenance shares the same lowered query machinery as ordinary reads.
The target peer-serving path consumes maintained terminal facts for result
membership, path/correlation coverage, payload/replacement/version witnesses,
policy witnesses, and read-frontier settlement, then materializes `ViewUpdate`s
from those facts plus peer inventory/runtime acknowledgements. Recomputing a
view update from current query rows is migration/oracle debt governed by ch. 16,
not an alternate production engine (`INV-LOWER-14`). Whole-table current-row
views are the normal table-rooted row-set shape, not a separate current-row
serving engine (`INV-LOWER-15`). Result-set ids stay separate from version
payloads via per-peer dedup (ch. 8). Exclusive predicate validation compares
predicate-output-set terminal facts for the shape+binding at
`base_snapshot.global_base` against now (degenerate whole-table predicates use
the global-currency-changed probe) (`INV-LOWER-16`, ch. 3).

Result membership facts are typed at the lowering boundary. Real-row membership
must preserve enough identity to distinguish content, deletion, branch,
historic/snapshot, schema-projected, and batch-scoped membership. Synthetic
aggregate/window rows emit member identity plus a `ResultPayload` fact carrying
the custom encoded record bytes. Relation/path lowering emits non-lossy path
facts rather than hiding edge kind, versions, depth, branch alternative, order,
role, or hole state in opaque revisions.

### 14.6 Access-path selection

The source resolver selects access paths by deterministic rule, never by cost
model or statistics:

1. equality on a primary-key prefix → point/prefix scan spec;
2. equality on a declared/derived boundary-arrangement key → arrangement probe;
3. global-sequence-bounded reads (historical cuts, branch bases, reconnect
   enumeration) → range scan spec over the `by_table_global_seq` arrangement;
4. otherwise → full scan, loudly counted (full-scan counters are part of the
   operational surface, ch. 17).

v1 consumers are implemented and tested: one-shot filtered reads;
position-bounded historical and branch-cut reads, which take the
`by_table_global_seq` bounded range path and must agree row-for-row with the
full-scan currentness oracle while touching only the requested global-sequence
range (`INV-LOWER-23`; this is what makes branch `at()` and historical reads
bounded rather than gated); dry-run policy
probes; and recursion seed hydration (`INV-LOWER-22`–`INV-LOWER-24`). The
source resolver still fails loudly when a requested source cannot be represented
by a sound static path; the fallback is a counted full scan, not a different
semantic evaluator. Prepared-shape steady-state probing is the later
overlay-probe phase (groove ch. 4 §4.6).

### 14.7 Existence lowering for inherited-parent policy joins

Inherited-parent authorization (`inherits(parent_column)`) is existence
semantics: a child row is visible iff at least one qualifying derivation
(access edge × membership path) exists for the parent, per identity. The
normalizer marks this join `JoinMode::Semi`; the lowering implements it as a
derivation-collapse, not a groove semi-join:

1. project the parent-policy subtree down to exactly the join keys plus the
   route fields it carries (claim route fields included);
2. `arg_max_by` grouped on all of those fields — rows within a group are
   identical post-projection, so losing one of several derivations emits no
   output delta and losing the last retracts the group;
3. plain inner join against the reduced side; downstream field/route
   bookkeeping is unchanged (`last_join_right` carries the reduced field set).

Two constraints force this shape over a plain `SemiJoin` node:

- **Multisink identity routing.** One shared program serves every bound
  identity of a prepared shape; result rows are routed to subscribers by their
  claim route-field values. The claim must therefore survive to the join
  output as a runtime-bound field — never baked as a literal (prepared graphs
  are shared across identities), and never erased (a groove `SemiJoin` emits
  left rows only, which would destroy per-identity attribution).
- **Maintained deltas across permission changes.** The parent set must stay
  dynamic; freezing visible parents at open time would drop deltas for
  children under later-granted or later-revoked parents.

Without this, hydration computes each child once per derivation and
consolidates the excess away (observed: ~2.4M intermediate rows for 24k
visible children; warm reopen 4.3s → 0.4s with the collapse in place).

### 14.8 Subsumed lowering backlog

The former public-schema-subset, SQL dialect, explicit-index, and top-k notes are
folded into this chapter as lowering work. Public schema features may exist
before core execution supports them, but any executable schema must pass one
shared validator before it reaches storage or runtime open. Query, policy, and
SQL entry surfaces lower to groove through the same shape identity.

Ordered-window and top-k lowering should prefer an ordered index path when the
requested order and filters can be satisfied by storage. The fallback remains
correct materialize/sort/limit behavior, but the optimized path must preserve
policy filtering, pagination, and live subscription maintenance.

## Open Questions

### Open questions

- ✅ **Policy lowering** (`INV-LOWER-20`). Read policy and write admission both
  lower through `node/query_engine`. Write admission supplies policy-pinned
  old/candidate rows as inline roots and evaluates them with the authenticated
  identity over current or branch sources; the former direct interpreter has
  been removed.
- 🔶 **Bytes primary keys.** The README lists bytes PKs as a "new" groove ask, but
  the implementation already uses `PrimaryKeyColumn::bytes` in several lowered
  tables — treat as satisfied rather than pending.
- 🔶 **Alias non-leakage coverage.** Alias→UUID remapping is done on decode, but
  no focused test proves aliases never leak on the wire for nested tx-id fields
  (`INV-LOWER-3` is `untested` until covered).
- 🔶 **Historical implicit-include source coverage.** Historical root reads with
  filters and ordinary joins lower through `HistoryCut` sources, but shapes whose
  normalizer adds an implicit root-reference auxiliary source (for example an
  include used only to filter child rows by a parent table) do not yet add an
  aligned historical source expression for that auxiliary source. Until
  source-aware include coverage is wired into the historical read-set builder,
  these benchmark phases must report a visible
  `[needs: historical-implicit-include-source-coverage]` gate rather than being
  silently counted.
- 🔶 **Existence lowering beyond inherits.** §14.7's derivation-collapse is
  applied only to inherited-parent policy joins. Reachable-closure and policy
  atom-chain joins carry the same existence semantics and plausibly the same
  per-derivation fanout on edge-heavy schemas; extending the collapse needs the
  same route-field and maintained-delta analysis per site, plus a receipt that
  the fanout actually exists there. A real groove `Distinct` (today an
  unsupported marker op) would subsume the `arg_max_by` encoding.
- 🔶 **Policy authorization source node.** Read policy lowering currently bridges
  policy authorization through a physical authorized-row-id graph before joining
  it back to the base source. Decide the first-class groove/source node for
  policy authorization facts so source authorization remains in the query engine
  without relying on a materialized bridge.
- 🔶 **Executable schema subset.** Reject unsupported public schema constructs at
  every execution entry point using one validator, including dynamic defaults,
  unsupported column types, reserved metadata, and planner-ineligible features.
- 🔶 **Declarative indices.** Replace "index all columns" with explicit
  developer-declared indices, plus a migration story for existing tables and
  planner diagnostics when a query falls back.
- 🔶 **Ordered top-k lowering.** Recognize `ORDER BY ... LIMIT/OFFSET` shapes
  that can use ordered storage scans, preserve policy/filter composition, and
  keep maintained subscriptions bounded.
- 🔶 **Policy constant folding.** Fold claim/literal constants consistently
  across read policy, write policy, and query-time authorization without hiding
  dependency edges that can later change.
- 🔶 **Smart automatic indices.** Automatic index recommendations may follow
  explicit indices, but must be diagnostics or migrations rather than silent
  planner behavior that changes storage shape unexpectedly.
