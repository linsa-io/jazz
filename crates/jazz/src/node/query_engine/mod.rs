#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Destination vocabulary for the unified Jazz query engine.
//!
//! The compiler boundary is deliberately smaller than the set of public
//! facades:
//!
//! 1. public query and relation builders normalize into one row-set shape,
//! 2. callers choose one read view and one policy context,
//! 3. callers request app rows, internal facts, or a policy decision,
//! 4. one lowering pass resolves sources, policy, relation semantics, sync
//!    coverage, payload witnesses, and transaction read tracking into Groove
//!    IVM graphs.
//!
//! Snapshot reads, live subscriptions, and sync scopes are lifecycles around
//! the same lowered row-set program. They do not participate in lowering keys.
//! Cached subscription results are likewise runtime state, not a read source.
