## 2.0.0-alpha.54

## 2.0.0-alpha.53

## 2.0.0-alpha.52

## 2.0.0-alpha.51

## 2.0.0-alpha.50

### Patch Changes

- f463ae9: Drop Node.js 20 support. Minimum is now Node.js 22.12 (Jod LTS). `engines.node` is set to `>=22.12` on `jazz-tools` and `create-jazz`; consumers on Node 20 will see an `EBADENGINE` warning (npm/pnpm) or a hard install failure (Yarn).

## 2.0.0-alpha.49

## 2.0.0-alpha.48

## 2.0.0-alpha.47

### Patch Changes

- bc68b95: Add three TypeScript (no framework) starters: `ts-localfirst`, `ts-hybrid`, and `ts-betterauth`. Each mirrors its `react-*` counterpart but uses direct DOM manipulation inside the Jazz subscription callback, so users can see the underlying Jazz API without a UI framework in the way. The Hono + BetterAuth server in `ts-hybrid` and `ts-betterauth` is byte-identical to the corresponding `react-*` server (enforced by the parity script).

  Also expose the existing `react-localfirst`, `react-hybrid`, and `react-betterauth` starters in the interactive picker as the "React (Vite)" framework option, and accept them via `--starter` (they were previously rejected as unknown).

## 2.0.0-alpha.46

## 2.0.0-alpha.45

### Patch Changes

- 2ee98be: Add sync protocol version checks to the WebSocket handshake so incompatible clients and servers fail with an explicit update prompt.

## 2.0.0-alpha.44

## 2.0.0-alpha.43

### Patch Changes

- 5dec68f: Advance the `create-jazz` spinner to "Provisioning Jazz Cloud app" during the dashboard call, and stop credential/banner output from concatenating onto the active spinner line.

## 2.0.0-alpha.42

## 2.0.0-alpha.41

## 2.0.0-alpha.40

### Patch Changes

- 206f0a9: The "Resolving dependencies" spinner now updates as each package resolves (e.g. `Resolving dependencies (2/5)`), so `npm create jazz` no longer appears frozen during that step.
- b988375: chore: expand scaffold test coverage to all six self-hosted starters

## 2.0.0

### Patch Changes

- c5534e1: Initial release of `create-jazz` — an interactive CLI scaffolder (`npm create jazz`) with six starter templates spanning Next.js and SvelteKit across three auth modes (local-first, hybrid, BetterAuth). Resolves `workspace:*` and `catalog:` dependency references to published versions at scaffold time.
